both ÿ and ÿ	I like both cats and dogs.
so	Jane likes cats. So do I.
not ÿ either	Jane doesn't like cats. I don't like cats either.
either ÿ or ÿ	Jane either has a cat or a dog.
neither/nor	Jane doesn't like cats. Neither do I./Nor do I.
neither ÿ nor ÿ	I like neither cats nor dogs.

Neither cats nor teenagers turn their heads when you call them.
You would hardly ever see a cat walking outside of the house with its master. Nor would you see a teenager in public with his or her parents very often.
A cat doesn't share your taste in music. A teenager doesn't either
Both cats and teenagers can lie on the sofa for hours on end without moving.
Cats expect you to prepare the food for them. So do teenagers.
If you tell a joke, neither your cat nor your teen will laugh about it.
If you make a sudden move in their direction, both cats and teenagers get frightened.
Cats do not improve your furniture. Teenagers don't either
Cats roam outside and often come home very late at night. So do teenagers.
Conclusion: no matter if you either have a cat or a teenager at home - it's all the same.
