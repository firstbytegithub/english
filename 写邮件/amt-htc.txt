Hi AMT folks,

As mentioned in the mail below, not only U13, U17 and U12 also suffer
good, experience engineers leaving. Furthermore, in some cases people
leave before qualified replacements onboard or job transfer completion,
which cost MASD more effort in on-job training and assignment
rescheduling.

 

Please take this phenomenon as a serious indication that the MASD has
significant concern about  personnel stability of AMT, and corresponding
improvement plan is expected. 

 

Please let me know if there is any further question, and look forward to
your feedback. Thanks.  


Hi Baochi,
Due to hardware utilization and performance improvement, MIS redefines the
default hard drive volume to 150G:
1.	Please ask AMT partners to clean up the hard drive by removing
obsolete data;
2.	MIS will start hard drive reconfiguration of each VM soon. The
process and schedule will be announced in advance by MIS before proceeding
3.	If there is any exception for larger capacity, please list the
reasons and expected size.

Please let me know if there is any further question. Thanks.

Hi Baochi,

 

Since there is already meeting arranged in the morning next Monday (5/20), shall we start the regular video conference from 5/27 (from AM 10:30 C 12:30)? (That is, the regular meeting next Monday still starts in the afternoon). Thanks.

Is it ok for you?

If you have any question, please let me know.

Hi Iver, as my understanding, all AMT users should be assigned a HTC mail account, and they should use this mail account for communication related to HTC tasks.

Hi Baomai, may I have your assistance to check the HTC mail account for them? Thanks a lot

Hi Baochi, Yan,
I will be in personal leave from 0503 to 0507, might not be able to access email in time. FYI.

Hi Baochi, 

After double check internally, AMT’s record is correct about ZM OT on
0316, which mean there is no other concern about AMT cost/attendance for
March 2013. Sorry for inconvenience.

(Loop in AMT git administrator Yan Wen)

Hi Yan,

As you might note that currently HTC is setup new IT development environment for outsourcing vendors, and we target to have pilot run with AMT between 0103 ~ 0115. Meanwhile, new git server and build server will be setup inside new IT environment and managed by HTC directly.

 

Here I loop in Jacky Lin, who is assigned as git server administrator for HTC git server. I will describe current MASD/SSD code sync mechanism by following up this mail, and would like to have your assistance to illustrate the process you run on current AMT git server while receiving code from MASD, so Jacky can leverage your experience to setup HTC git with similar mechanism 

 

Hi Jacky, 

Please allow me to introduce Yan, who is the administrator of AMT git server located inside ODC NJ. He helped HTC to setup gerrit and git server for code sync, code review and account management. Also he built up a build server inside ODC to facilitate build tasks triggered by AMT RD. I will initiate the topic about current code sync mechanism by following up this mail so we can discuss/setup the code sync up mechanism inside HTC Citrix VM environment. Thanks

 

Louis Hsu

----------------------------
Hi Yan, as discussion, please also think about the permission and working model AMT suggests to facilitate your development work. Thanks

Hi Baochi, Shirley,

Regarding resource forecast for Jan provided in the beginning of 12/2012, there might be some changes for MASD part:

1.       Steve expects MASD to expand outsourcing topic from current framework task to applications area, and would like to have pilot tasks initiated in Jan. This implies MASD needs more resources starting in Jan than the forecast we provided in Dec.

2.       Nevertheless, the topic, scope and resource requirement is not lockdown yet. 

3.       In order to leave buffer for candidates interview, lockdown and training if necessary, here is the plan:

-          MASD will update the resource requirement before 0109

-          MASD would like to lockdown resource list and start training/task on 0121

4.       As for Feb resource forecast, MASD will update a new one around mid of Jan after application outsourcing plan is more tangible.

 

Please let me know if there is any further question, and thanks for your assistance.

Hi Yan, Baochi, here is the topics and todo list:

1.       Test branch update mechanism with same branch name to keep build task script intact

2.       Check current Ubuntu VM to see if development environment can fulfill AMT RD request

3.       The build script of each build task

4.       Mechanism lockdown about source code sync/update with SCM inside Citrix

5.       Grant Yan permission on SCM gerrit for necessary git operation

 

Furthermore, Baochi, as Mail/OCS setup and activation:

1.       Please install OCS and other required Windows application (mail, office, e.g.) on your local desktop inside ODC. The reason is:

-          To relieve the physical server loading and bandwidth

-          Simplify the network configuration/management inside Citrix 

2.       Regarding your local desktop configuration, I will suggest to install Ubuntu with VirtualBox to run Windows

3.       Regarding the copyright and license of MSFT software and OS, I will discuss with Shirley (AMT) and KL (HTC) to clarify it.

 

Please let me know if there is any further question. Thanks.

Hi Yafeng, 

May I have your assistance to check if 2 gerrit servers work correctly:

-          http://58.213.152.250:8443/

 

It seems both are not available now.

Hi Colin, thanks for your feedback.

Basically we will like to understand the experience and working model Archermind runs with other clients, so HTC can identify the app suitable for outsourcing and adopts fitting working model for further collaboration.

 

If there is no problem, I will send out the meeting invitation directly with conf call info. Thanks

 

Louis Hsu

Hi Colin,
After confirmation with Steve, attachment is the resource requirement and contact window list of tasks from MASD (please note the contact windows might be changed, and will update to you if any change occurs)
 
As mentioned in the performance review meeting on 1022, HTC/MASD would like to set 1101 as project kick-off date. Please start the discussion with each contact window directly to have clear idea about task assignment and resource requirement (basically we will like to keep the same crew for the tasks ran in the pilot project). Please let me know if there is any further question.
 
Hi HTC folks, Colin is RD manager from AMT for HTC outsourcing project. Please initiate the discussion directly to AMT for your task/assignment and training plan if any.
 
Louis Hsu

Hi Colin, regarding candidates for U13 and U25, I assume the original crew in pilot project should be allocated for further proceeding. As for U12, Fish Weng will provide the detail job description and candidates criteria. Thanks

Hi Fish, please help to list down job description and candidate criteria for emulator and SDK whitebox verification, thanks

Hi folks,

In order to move current git repository into new git server with merging current AMT multiple build lines into one mainline, AMT would need to work on one fixed code base, so we are planning to suspend source code sync from HTC to AMT side until next Monday (0114) with movement completion.

Please let me know if you have any concern or special requirement, or we will suspend regular code sync starting from tonight. Thanks

Hi Yafeng, 

According to the update from Vincent, I will wait for the update from Vincent around 1730 to confirm the final IP address.

 

Hi Yan, since public IP is change, do I need to change the script accordingly for rsync?

 

Louis Hsu

Hi Susi,
Here is the how to: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=626540
Not sure if it's still valid though.

Hi Baochi, can you give it a try?

Louis Hsu

----------------------------
Hi Yan, 

git gc is completed. Since TPE office will be shutdown from 0600~0900 tomorrow for annual maintenance, I will run rsync now manually, shutdown the mirror server and restart it on Sunday. Please let me know if there is any further question

 

BTW, do I have to run git gc periodically?

(Loop in U25 members)

Hi Baochi, after internal resource review and discussion:

1.       Please help to arrange U11舒三毛 to leave the project team on 0531, and U11 will stay in 10 resource headcount (original is 11). The tasks of舒三毛 will be taken care by U11 outsourcing resource re-arrangement

2.       The one extra headcount will be assigned to U25 for COS browser support. So before adjustment U25 headcount is:

Android browser: 3

COS browser: 1

After adjustment:

Android browser: 3

COS browser: 2

3.       As far as I know the candidates for COS browser support (2) are not available yet, please help to accelerate the resource allocation process

 

Hi Chihwei, Tom,

As mentioned above, there will be one extra AMT headcount to U25 for COS browser support, which implies the total AMT headcount for U25 is increased from 4 to 5. Please let me know if there is any further question. Thanks.

Hi Louis

 

As discussion, please help to arrange 4 more AMT resources to invoke on Dalvik related tasks.

Requirements:

1. Senior engineers with good coding experience

2. Familiar with C, C++, ARM instruction set  

3. Dalvik/Android related working experience

 

As usual, we will have interview for the candidates

thanks


----------------------------
Hi Hankuan, 

So let me rephrase your request and my question:

1.       The resource head account for U13 is from current 6 to 8 (2 more from AMT)

2.       Regarding resource allocation:

Dalvik C from 4 to 8 (So you still need to acquire 4 new resources from AMT?)

Test case C from 2 to 0 (So you will release these 2 or transfer to Dalvik task? If release, when is the due date)

 

Louis Hsu

Hi Baochi, attachment is the process we would like to adopt for account update. At present Alice Chen will be the owner for AMT account update and onboard package application based on the headcount update information from SP/email from AMT. 

 

Please let me know if there is any further question. Thanks. 

 

Louis Hsu


----------------------------
Hi Baochi, this is only for MASD TW since Alice can only take care MASD account changing. However you might want to propose similar process to other HTC depts from AMT perspective to unify the account management.

Hi all, 
Due to security concern, we have to block all non-authorized IM traffic inside ODC. Currently only HTC OCS is allowed to be installed on Archermind local PC only for instant communication so MIS can control/manage the operation and information leakage risk.

As for virtual desktop requirement, may I know if this is the blocker for UA team to run code review and deliverable discussion? As my understanding:
1. Source code is uploaded to P4 server (RoseData), so both sides can run code review via P4
2. As for look-and-feel discussion, both sides can access test site for instant interface change by updating code.

Indeed the virtual desktop can accelerate the communication and coordination between HTC/AMT, and we still work with MIS to see if there is other way to achieve this goal. Thanks for your understanding, and please let me know if there is any further question. 

Louis Hsu

----------------------------
Hi Baochi, can you help to check:
1. If ZM can install Windows as native/primary OS on his local PC inside ODC
2. Install official MSFT OCS client on local PC to support text/audio/video and virtual desktop

Please let me know if there is any further question. Thanks

Louis

Dear Baochi,

Thanks for the info, I already accept 王宗民's invitation.

By the way, we will setup some rules with 宗民 and send you report by weekly for your reference.  And the rules maybe slightly change depending on conditions, please feel free to let me know if you have any concerns.

 

1.       Write daily status report.

2.       AMT developer will receive task via Manits.  

  a.  Due date (the date AMT Web Developer and HTC get consensus mutually, if the due date is slipped without acceptable reason, then it is overdue)

  b.  Start date: (the date AMT Web developer starts to perform the task)

  c.   End date:(the date AMT developer finishes the task by attached 2 test reports in the mantis)

  d.  2 Test reports include pass klocwork, and test service.

  e.  Actual finished date (HTC web owner official release date)

3.       AMT developer must check-in built pass code daily in perforce.

4.       Before check-in built pass code, HTC web owner must do code review, and examine if the codes are followed coding convention, written comment, function meets our expectation, and code quality, etc..

5.       We will base on above 4 items [1. Daily status report, 2. on-time delivery 3. Discipline, 4. Quality] to review developer and send the report to AMT PM, Baochi weekly. 

6.       We will not accept if final code has fatal bug or slip due date without reasonable reason, if so, AMT developer must provide root cause, solution and improved plan.

Sincerely,

Sophia

Hi Baochi, as my understanding SSD had encountered the similar issue before. In fact if my memory is correct, that's the first case Kan complained Citrix solution is not workable while using WINE to run Windows diff application.

The configuration for Ubuntu VM is pretty high end (16-core + 8G memory), and I guess WINE solution on Linux might cause some performance flaw whiling running on visualization platform (might need to some tech support from Citrix

At present what I can suggest is to use native Linux application for source code tracing and editing.

Hi Sophia, Eliza

In order to accelerate the outsourcing process, may I have your assistance to provide candidate qualification and head accounts required before EOD today (0109)? If possible I will like to initiate candidate interview process no later next Monday (0114), or we can have detail discussion with AMT directly this week to understand the scope of tasks going to outsource.

 

Please let me know your feedback and schedule. Thanks.
