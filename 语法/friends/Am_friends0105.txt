Monica: Am not! 
Ross: Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Monica: Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? (goes over to the kitchen to check on the dinner) No, cause I made lasagne. (to Rachel) Am I out of control?
Carol: Am I allowed to drink anything?
MR. TREEGER: No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right.
MR. GELLER: Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
JOEY: This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
Joey: Am I in it?
Ross: Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
Monica: You sat back and let him have her, you didn’t fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
Ross: Am I?!
Ross: Am I?!
Chandler: (entering) Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
Ross: Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
Frank: (To Phoebe) Hey! Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right?
Alice: (running in from the elevator) Am I too late?!
Ross: Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
Monica: Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
Rachel: Aww, Joey, come here. (She takes his hand.) Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
Chandler: I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I’m right. I'm right. Am I right?
