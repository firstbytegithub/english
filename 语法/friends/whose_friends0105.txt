Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Janice: Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed? 
Chandler: Okay... (returning to the board) ..whose turn is it?
ROSS: I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
MRS. GELLER: Ross, whose glasses are those?
Rachel: Yeah, sure. (To Monica) All right, whose court is the ball in now?
Joey: My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
