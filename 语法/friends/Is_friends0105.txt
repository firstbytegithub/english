Monica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? 
Ross: Is there somebody else? 
Monica: Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Ross: Is it? Feels like two.
Chandler: She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (pause) Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Chandler: I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
Shelley: Is Brian...?
Mrs. Geller: Is everything all right, dear?
Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! (They stop talking and look up) Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?
Carol: Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
Chandler: Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan and Jan Forever.
Monica: Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
Steve: (from the living room) Is it dry in here? (licks his lips)
Joey: Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
Mr. Geller: No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
Joey: Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
Phoebe: Is he alright?
Chandler: Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
Phoebe: A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
Aunt Iris: Is Tony Randall dead?
Rachel: Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
Monica: Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
Monica: What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Phoebe: So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your (provocatively) special someone?
Monica: Is he not cute enough for you?
Monica: Is there? Is there someone else?
RACHEL: At his apartment. Is this juice?
RACHEL: Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
MONICA: Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanna, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
MONICA: Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
RACHEL: Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
ROSS: Is there blood coming out of my ears?
CHANDLER: Is it--?
JANICE: Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.
RACHEL: Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?
MONICA: Is your tongue swelling up?
JOEY: Is he gonna be ok?
CHANDLER: Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
CHANDLER AND JOEY: Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
CHAN: OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?
MICH: Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?
ROSS: No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?
RACH: She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
RACH: [to Monica] Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.
GRANDMOTHER: Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.
PHOEBE: Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
CHAN: It's alright. Is she good-looking?
SUSAN: Is your finger caught in that chair?
MRS. WALLACE: Is she gonna be all right?
ROSS: Is everything ok?
MRS GREEN: Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.
MONICA: Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
MONICA: Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
WAITER: Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?
ERICA: Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?
ERICA: Is this true?
ERICA: Is all this true?
KID: Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth?
JOEY: Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?
DIRECTOR'S ASSISTANT: Is it bad?
INTERVIEWER: Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
RACHEL: [the shoulders of her dress keep falling off her shoulders] Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .
JOEY: Is that the fire alarm?
PHOEBE: What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?
PHOEBE: I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?
PHOEBE: OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?
ROSS: Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?
RACHEL: Is Ross here?
ROSS: [looking at a glass table with a panther shaped base] Look, check this out. Is it a coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide.
EDDIE: [annoying laugh] Is this guy great or what?
PHOEBE: Is anyone else starting to really like him?
CHANDLER: Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. [starts poking Monica in the shoulder] 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
RICHARD: Is everything all right?
LITTLE BULLY: Is that supposed to be funny?
PHOEBE: Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?
MR. GREENE: Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes?
GIRL 1: Is it true they have beer?
RICHARD: Monica... [He re-enters the bedroom and Monica jumps on the bed, trying to cover it.] Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
ROSS: Is this what you had in mind?
Phoebe: (on machine) "Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?" (to the guys) Is that too spooky?
Rachel: (entering from her room) Is this a little too... (sees Phoebe) Pheebs, what happened?
Chandler: Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
Chandler: Is anybody else scared?
Isabella: Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
Monica: Is it the Italian guy?
Chandler: No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
Phoebe: Is that a problem?
Chandler: Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
Monica: Is this the one that I threw out last year?
Rachel: (to him) Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Chandler: Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie? 
Rachel: Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. (to Phoebe) Is this actually a lunchbox? 
Man: (entering) Is there a Julio here? 
Rachel: (softly) Is he here?
Chandler: (reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete... (quickly grabs a magazine and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?
Monica: You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
Frank: Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I'd curl up in it. Is that all right?
Alice: Phoebe's right Frank. I know it's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. (to Phoebe) Is that it, is that what it is?
Kate: Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Chandler: Is there any chance you didn't see that?
Kate: Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Joey: Yeah! Oh my God! (to Chandler) Is this what it's like to be you?
Pete: Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
Ross: Well what is it? Is it a mole? (He moves closer to them, and they jump back.) 
Ross: Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
Joey: Yeah, yeah. He's got a, he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
Monica: Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
Monica: Is that all?
Monica: (Picking up a card from Chandler’s wallet.) My God! Is this a gym card?
Bank Officer: Close your accounts? Is there some kind of problem?
Chandler: Is it on?
Joey: Is she great or what?
Phoebe: Oo! Is it for my birthday present? 
Joey: (Unimpressed) A book? (Suddenly interested) Is it like a book that's also a safe? 
Ross: Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
Chandler: No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
Chandler: Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
Chandler: Is that a real thing?
Joey: Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like "Well, kinda.") Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
Rachel: Is he okay in there?
KATHY: Well, I’m still sorry. Is he here?
Rachel: Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
Mike: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
Phoebe: Wow, a year and a half ago I didn’t even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too. (They all hug, and Frank and Alice start kissing.) Okay. Okay. Stop it, don’t. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?
Rachel: What the hell is that?!! (to Monica) What the hell is that? Is that you? (Monica nods her head no, and Rachel realizes what is making that sound.) Ohhhhhhh! (storms over to Chandler and Joey’s with Monica in trail.) 
Chandler: Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
Kathy's Co-Star: Is that an expensive blouse?
Janice: What’s the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
Joey: Is it the shampoo? It’s guava.
Joey: Oh! Wait-wait! (Reaches inside the shower.) Is it my bologna sandwich?
Rachel: Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Joey: Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must’ve hit something on the remote.
Ross: Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
Rachel: Is that the heartbeat?
Joshua: (getting up and backing away from they.) Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. It’s just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!
Ross: Is that—are you saying yes? Is that yes?
Ross: Is this about Mark?
Rachel: What’s this? Is this Ross’s wedding invitation?
Monica: You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren’t there. Just say you’ll think about it, okay?
Mr. Waltham: You want a piece of me, sir? Is that what your saying? (Pointing at Jack and poking him) You want a piece of me?
Chandler: Oh. Y’know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn’t because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me ‘cause, you’re really hot! Is that okay?
Rachel: Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
Frank: I can't believe there's somebody coming out of you right now. There's somebody coming out of you! Is it? Is it? It's my son.
Rachel: Chandler! (Pause) Is he?
Ross: Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
Rachel: Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
Joey: Argh-argh!! (Catches the coat.) Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
Joey: I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
Monica: Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
Monica: What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
Monica: What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress? (She turns around making sure he gets a good look.)
Danny: (Looking at Monica) Absolutely! Is Friday okay?
Phoebe: Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.
Jay Leno: (On TV to Dick Clark) Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?
Joey: Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
Joey: You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
Chandler: (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
Rachel: Is he romantic with her?
Rachel: I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
Ross: Is everything okay?
Man: Oops, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Is this the umm, the memorial?
Chandler: Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
Monica: Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Chandler: Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Joey: (holding up the Queen of Clubs) Is that your card? (He winks and smiles.)
Carol: Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
Phoebe: Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
The Casting Director: Is there a problem?
Chandler: Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
Monica: Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
Joey: (entering) Hey! Is the show still on?
Joey: (says hi to his grandma) Look! Oh! (Pointing out the window.) Is that the Pope?! (Chandler and his grandma turn to look and Joey slips a tape into the VCR.)
Monica: We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
Joey: Is everything okay?
Joey: Is something wrong?
Rachel: Is Monica here?
Chandler: Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
Joey: Is this movie gonna be my big break?
Joey: Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
Chandler: (who has just entered) Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Chandler: (To Phoebe) Is that Joey?! (She nods yes) Let me talk to him!
Ross: Is that supposed to be an insult?
Ross: Is that so?
The Security Guard: (To Phoebe) Is that true miss?
