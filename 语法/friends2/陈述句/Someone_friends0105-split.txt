Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life
Someone at work ate my sandwich
Someone comment on the pants
Someone cut Howard's cake
Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo—it's—it's a whole big bone thing
Someone get a little action
Someone I know is getting married
Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate
Someone knocked over a lamp
Someone knocks on the door and it rears up at him
Someone knocks on the door and Monica gets it
Someone knocks, so they hurriedly separate to stare out of the window
Someone musta stolen my credit card
Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins
Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl
Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel"
Someone you didn’t make up
