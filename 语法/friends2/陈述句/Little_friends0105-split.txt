Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood
Little engagement gift
Little high fives
Little Leslie is here
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you
Little Marcel, wrapped in a fluffy towel, is cradled in Ross's arms
Little ones
Little tip
Little toast here, ding ding
Little village people
