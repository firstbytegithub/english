Somebody calls out 'heads up' and the volleyball lands in the flan] Wow, those things almost never come true
Somebody got a haircut
Somebody kiss me
Somebody kiss me, it's midnight
Somebody let me out please
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess
Somebody wanna help me out here
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart
Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend
Somebody was using his head
Somebody who wants to sleep with me
