A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me
A little foos
A little girl is beating him up
A little kid spit on my knee
A little old lady walks up to make a donation but Phoebe stops her
A little salami
A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do
