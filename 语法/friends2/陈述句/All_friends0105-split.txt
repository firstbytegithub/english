All guys that are awake
All I got was a lousy key chain
All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours
All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca
All I have to do is close my eyes
All I heard through 4 years of college was (makes a humming noise
All I… (Joey hangs up the phone in disgust
All I'm saying is just talk to Frank
All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna
All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth
All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna melt and four plates of curly fries
All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge
All I said was, 'This was fun
All I say is, she better get the job
All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex
All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring
All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon
All of them
All of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book
All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser

All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie
All right, all right, so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting, then ’94 hit, Carol left him and bamn
All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go
All right, all right, well I'm sorry, we'll put some ice on it
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid
All right, and umm… (She grabs the picture and smacks her in the head

All right, look at my on the back page
All right look, forget it, forget it
All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay
All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y’know, you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself
All right look, if you’re not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them
All right look, I gotta know
All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it’s all your fault
All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross
All right look, I’m changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer
All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok
