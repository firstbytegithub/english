I don't know, he just started kissing me
I don’t know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas
I don’t know how museums work in England but, here, you’re not supposed to take stuff
I don’t know how to lead
I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me

I don't know, I don't have my jammies
I don't know, I don't know
I don’t know, I don’t know
I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do

I don’t know if I could ever do that
I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know

I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am
I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day_
I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show
I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again
I don't know I guess I just got scared
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember
I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night
I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and
I don't know, I lost it all ok
I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just

I just, I think he just really likes you
I just, I thought Joey was there
I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love
I just—I wanna be around her as much as I can
I just—I want you to be happy
I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this
I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff
I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this
I just, just do this
I just kissed her
I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you
I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there
I just know it would make me happy
I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain
I just meant hypothetically
I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more
I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat
I just met you, I don't know you from Adam
I just needed to tell you
I just need to be by myself for a while, you know
I just need to talk to my friend
I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross
I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park
I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo
I just pretend to be a doctor
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off
I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together
I just remembered, I have to do something
I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order
I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her
I just saw Janice
I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside
I just say someone on the—that looks just like you on the subway
I just sharpened her this morning
I just spelled the wrong word
I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit
I just spoke to your dad, and you know what
I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you
I just think it's nice when we're all here together
I just think it's weird, you know
I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or
I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life
I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat
I just think that this is happening too soon
I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know
I just think you're nice
I just thought he was nice, y'know
I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero
I just thought I might
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did
I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit
I just thought we might be here for awhile
I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob
I just took your hat
I just touched him and he went over
I just uh, came by to pick up my mail
I just wanna be alone right now
I just wanna call everyone I know
I just wanna check something
I just wanna clarify this
I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body
I just wanna make sure it fits
I just wanna read something
I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma
I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh
I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best
I just wanna-(sees Monica)-Ahhh
I just wanna thank you for being there for me today
I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else
I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy
I just wanted to see how it's going
I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party
I just want him to love you like I do
I just want it the way it was
I just want this to be (Kicks off his left shoe) about what it is
I just wan't to
I just want to get over him
I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends
I just want to humiliate him
I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man
I just want to watch a little television
I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and
I just want you to remember this feeling
I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now
I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed
I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me
I just went for it
I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers
I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are
I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked
I just wish there was something we could do
I just work here
I just- you decide
I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast
I kept myself busy
I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out
I killed another one
I killed him
I kinda feel like it's my fault
I kinda got plans
I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of
I kinda had a dream, (pause) but I don't want to talk about it
I kinda have a dream
I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it
I kinda like that you worry about me
I kinda scared myself
I kind of lost him
I kissed Kathy
I knew
I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it
I knew it
I KNEW IT
I knew it, wow
I knew that
I knew you'd understand
I knew you were going to do this
I knew you were not okay with that
I know
I know-
I KNOW
I know about you two
I know a great little place
I know a guy who's the 18th
I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me
I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so
I know, and I’ve only been playing for like an hour
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head
I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid
I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now
I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just… (goes into her bedroom
I know, but—come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds
I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know
I know, but it's my job, sweethart
I know but it’s so hard
I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think
I know, but, I was the best, you know
I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it’s snowballing, y’know
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it
I know, but you have to open it today
I know, he's just so, so
I know he's the love of your life
I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him
I know honey, I'm sorry
I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore
I know how you can get him, take off your bra
I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset
I know I am
I know, I can do more than cook
I know, I can do this
I know I do
I know if you were getting married I’d feel, kinda…
I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with
I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date
I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip
I know, I know
I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles
I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her
I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person
I know, I know, but you’re gonna have plenty of chances
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I'm sorry-
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot
I know, I know, it's, it's almost
I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on
I know, I know that wasn't about me
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents
I know I'm no John Bon Jovi, (Monica laughs) or someone who find attractive, I'm just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently
I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings
I know, I'm so excited
I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker
I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you
I know I really miss him
I know, I remember that
I know, isn't he great
I know isn’t it
I know, I still am one of these
I know it doesn't make much sense…
I know, it is
I know, it is isn't it
I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah
I know it is the best
I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't
I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um
I know, it's beautiful
I know, it's crazy
I know it's crazy, but it's true
I know it’s frightening, but, big picture
I know, it's great
I know it's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it
I know, it’s horrible isn’t it
I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it
I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone
I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better
I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is (Goes and picks up the sandwich) the greatest sandwich in the world
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships
I know, it’s sick
I know, it’s such a huge, life-altering thing
I know, it's tough
I know, it was amazing
I know, it was the best I could get out of them
I know, I’ve been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don’t you think
I know I will
I know I would
I know, me neither
I know, me too
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving
I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross
I known Ross for a long time
I know queen is high
I know, really well
I know, so do I
I know that
I KNOW THAT
I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way
I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train of thought, temporarily) that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid
I know that much
I know that one
I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore
I know that switch does something, okay
I know that there’s no hole there, I just really liked that picture
I know that too
I know the code to his answering machine
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is
I know there was wine
I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head
I know, this is a great apartment
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing
I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting
I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow
I know, though
I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge
I know, uh, the air, the-the trees
I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other
I know, what about Rachel
I know what I am doing
I know what it did
I know what's going on here
I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy
I know what you all are thinking
I know what you could make
I know what you meant
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard
I know what your problem is
I know where Joey would be
I know where Minsk is
I know where your dog is
I know who it is you remind me of
I know, why not
I know, yeah
I know, yeah, sorry
I know you
I know you can’t stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I’d try and apologize over the phone
I know you did
I know you did, cookie
I know you didn’t, I was talking about Monica
I know you do
I know you do but you and I can never be together that way
I know, you must've won like a contest or something
I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't
I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’m-I’m, I’m gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler
I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you
I know you're right
I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him
I learned that living on the street
I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did
I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don’t think your son will think it’s yours and be horribly traumatised
I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk
I left my wallet here on purpose
I left some knickers under your pillow
I licked my arm, what
I lied
I like Ben
I liked being the best
I liked him
I like 'em
I like her
I like her a lot actually
I like her, you know
I like it
I like it, and Emily likes it, and that’s what counts
I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders
I like it in the stern
I like mail
I like that
I like them a lot
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy
I like this lily
I like waking up with you too
I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place
I loathe myself
I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want
I look down and-and I know that this isn’t gonna be the most special day of my life
I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere
I looked into that
I look like an 8-year-old boy
I look more like him than you do
I lost it
I lost my sexy phlegm
I lost our mattresses
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands
I love both of you
I love children, I have children
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park
I loved this place
I love her
I love her books
I love him
I love how he cares so much about stuff
I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek
I love it
I love it, when we share
I love jam
I love Jennifer Van Murray's work
I love Joey
I love my sister (Kisses Monica), I love Pheebs
I love Rachel
I love spider burners
I love Thanksgiving
I love that
I love that guy
I love that joke
I love that movie
I love that thing
I love that voice
I love the "I forgot the present" fake out
I love this apartment
I love this artichoke thing
I love this bag
I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee
I love this coat
I love this game
I love this guy
I love this job
I love this party
I love this shirt
I love to ride that rail
I love Vegas
I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin
I love working with designers
I love ya man
I love you
I love you both
I love you, but you're crazy
I love you Drake
I love you goddesses
I love you guys
I love you, love you
I love you, man
I love you, Monica
I love you Phoebe
I love you, Ross
I love you too
I love you, too
I love you too, all righty
I love you too Chandler
I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes
I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage
I made a man twice my size cry
I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room
I made a promise that-(they cut to the other camera and Ross notices something coming out of Rachel's nose)-Oh hey
I made a snap judgement
I made fun of his accent
I made this game what it is
I majored in lightning rounds
I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that
I make low-budget adult films
I make the decisions, and I say no
I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired
I may have
I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but
I may have something in the back
I may not know any of your flash dances but I'm no slouch on the dance floor
I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot
I mean
I mean,
I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies
I mean after all, we all are using it
I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya
I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it
I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment
I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right
I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes
I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO
I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you
I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants
I mean, and you know how people can be wrong
I mean, anthropologically speaking-
I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce
I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you
I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something
I mean, because the thing is…
I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you
I mean, Ben
I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo
I mean bullets have left guns slower
I mean… But-but I assure you I will figure it out
I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine
I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet
I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922
I mean come on
I mean, come on
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car
I mean come on, it's been twelve years
I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you
I mean, Days of Our Lives
I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it
I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own
I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love
I mean, don't do that
I mean, don't get me wrong
I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already
I mean don't you trust her
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of
I mean, do you want me to stay
I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work
I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart
I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to
I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what
I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything
I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it’s-it’s so great
I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says
I mean, except in my own head
I mean, first it's my jewelry
I mean first, you hate me
I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy
I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts
I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy
I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going
I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half
I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute
I mean, have you seen you
I mean have you thought about it
I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you
I mean he dials phones
I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend
I mean he just started going out with her
I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you
I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away
I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time
I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat
I mean, he’s like Joe Rugby
I mean, he's nice, he's cute
I mean (he sprays Phoebe with crumbs)
I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person
I mean hey
I mean, hey, y’know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y’know
I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone
I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing
I mean how are we even gonna ask her
I mean how can I accept a restaurant from hi-
I mean, how clean can teeth get
I mean, how could I do that
I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries
I mean how could you do this
I mean how could you not tell me
I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink
I mean, how hard can it be
I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler
I mean, how, how did this happen
I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"
I mean, how perfect is that
I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision
I mean, I
I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him
I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want
I mean, I can't break up with him
I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her
I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues
I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me
I mean, I could do all this stuff
I mean I could live in this thing
I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows
I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator
I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him
I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot
I mean… I don’t know, it’s just, I guess I know it’s going to be over soon
I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it
I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them
I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry
I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing
I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30
I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair
I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not
I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast
I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater
I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all
I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love
I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change
I mean if they had lost, we would’ve made them get rid of the birds
I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this
I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler
I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage
I mean, I gave Barry up, right
I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there’s y'know, a new mom
I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding
I mean, I have, I have to stop it
I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me
I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one
I mean, I haven’t done that since I was four and I washed my dad’s Porsche with rocks
I mean I haven’t sterilised it since the guys moved out
I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it
I mean, I have to respect her decision
I mean, I-I did what I had to do
I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters
I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe
I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared
I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn’t quite there
I mean, I-I-I don't get it (tries to drink the rest of the jam out of the jar and gets it all over his face, on his chin, nose, etc
I mean I-I-I love her, y’know
I mean, I-I-I've got to give my marriage another chance
I mean I-I-I was great
I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts
I mean, I-I’ve known him a lot longer
I mean, I,I will cleeeean it
I mean I just can’t, you know that I’m not good at confrontation
I mean, I just go down there every other day and
I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help
I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents
I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys
I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but
I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh
I mean, I know what I’m talking about
I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y’know, I know where everything goes, it’s always nice
I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid
I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but…
I mean I like uh, pizza
I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye
I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy
I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more
I mean, I’m always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you
I mean, I'm a very bad person
I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in
I mean, I'm disgusting
I mean, I mean
I mean, I mean don't' you think
I mean, I mean why not
I mean I’m getting pretty good at it
I mean, I'm going to, so
I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment
I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy
I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you
I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks
I mean, I'm not like you
I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet
I mean I'm playing by the rules
I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it
I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty
I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas
I mean, (in an Irish accent) it'll be grrreat
I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now
I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler
I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader
I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures
I mean, is it really so terrible
I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it
I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic
I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar
I mean, is that ridiculous
I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross
I mean it
I mean I talked for hours
I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night
I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now
I mean I think it's great
I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious
I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking
I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain
I mean, I thought we were happy
I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident
I mean it is soon
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team
I mean, it just feels right, don’t you think
I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it
I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine
I mean it'll, it'll just kill him
I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready
I mean, it must've been terrible
I mean, it's all my fault
I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material
I mean it's a regular space
I mean, it's a total party zoo
I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommate's girlfriend -- which by the way, I think she knows
I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so
I mean it’s better than you just-just moving here, ‘cause it’s us together forever, and that’s-that’s what I want
I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents
I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK
I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica
I mean, it's great, but…
I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute
I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know
I mean it’s just, it’s just climbing
I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary
I mean it’s like me and your dad, that’s a totally separate thing
I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know
I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date
I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out
I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby
I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one
I mean it’s not like we don’t have anything in common
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering
I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me
I mean it’s only been two days since he broke up with Kathy
I mean it’s over… (She stops suddenly, when she sees that demolition has already started
I mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back
I mean, it's Ross
I mean, it’s Ross
I mean it's so unexpected
I mean, it's such a stupid argument
I mean, it’s true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, we’ve grown apart, so, um
I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us
I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another
I mean it was fun one time
I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together
I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn’t you start feeling silly
I mean, it was never like that
I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it
I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it
I mean it would be different if it was way into the future –and-and-and we were getting married or something
I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here
I mean, I've never looked at you that way before
I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm
I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes
I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air
I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July
I mean I was nothing before you
I mean, I was sitting there
I mean, I will cleeeean it
I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men
I mean I would kill for this job
I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead
I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you
I mean just ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them
I mean, last night I got my ear pierced
I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough
I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot
I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment
I mean, let's say I do make it, alright
I mean, like, he's a grown up
I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know
I mean like the sweetest guy
I mean like, who was that
I mean, listen
I mean, look
I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't
I mean look at him, look at you, (Starts to whine like a baby and Joey just glares at him
I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills
I mean look how brutal this is
I mean, look, I left a note and everything
I mean, look-look today you escaped (Pause) (Not believing it) death, y'know
I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about
I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance
I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me
I mean maybe you didn’t hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua
I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing
I mean, mittens are nice
I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just
I mean my God
I mean my Mom never thought this would work out
I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know
I mean, name one famous person named Chandler
I mean, naturally, you know, I said no
I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies
I mean, noodle soup
I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child
I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples
I mean nothing bad can go down
I mean, no, you’re right
I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg
I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up
I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh
I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball
I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont
I mean our flame, whew, is on fire
I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer
I mean pregnant
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done
I mean, really
I mean really mean
I mean really, think about it
I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains
I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me
I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her
I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit
I mean, she lives there, I live here
I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out
I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business
I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage
I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you
I mean, she’s going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned
I mean, she-she’d have to uh, move here
I mean she's not gonna leave me
I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day
I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out
I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool
I mean soup
I mean, so you said my name
I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel
I meant Chandler
I meant er, (struggling to concentrate) young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor
I meant female nudity
I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean
I mean, that could be you and Emily
I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head
I mean, that guy with the toe thing
I mean that makes, that makes everything different
I mean that's allowed
I mean, that's a typical guy response
I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache
I mean, that's it
I mean that's like you using my toothbrush
I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime
I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound
I mean that’s two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here
I mean that's unbelievable
I mean, that’s what this is all about, right
I mean that switch is connected to something
I mean, that-that has got to mean something
I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play
I mean, that was just mean
I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you
I mean, that woman made you miserable
I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y’know, you think I’ll ever get there
I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away
I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one
I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex
I mean there's no way
I mean, there’s no way I can make myself taller now, y’know
I mean, there's really no easy way to say this
I mean there's so much we don't know about each other
I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream
I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif
I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing
I mean, they’re gonna be engaged for like what
I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd
I mean they’re trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would
I mean, things just sort of happen around you
I mean, think about it
I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'
I mean this guy abandoned you
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery
I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her
I mean this is amazing
I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity
I mean, this is just too big
I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay
I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair
I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more
I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing
I mean, this is so cool
I mean, this is twisted
I mean, this is unbelievable
I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like
I mean this poor woman
I mean this, this Casey should be takin' down my messages, ya know, or, or, Rachel and I should be together and, and we should get some kind of me, message service
I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us
I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare
I mean, this-this looks so great
I mean, this, this makes sense for us
I meant, me plus one
I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall
I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional
I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game
I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh
I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y’know, because-because it was you…
I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but
I mean, uh, who
I mean, umm
I mean underpants, mister, that's what I mean
I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself
I mean, was it Gina
I mean was that just me
I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that
I mean, way to go Ben
I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say
I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know
I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment
I mean, we ended up cuddling
I mean we had an agreement
I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad
I mean, we had fun
I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other
I mean we have such a good time together
I mean, we have to erase that
I mean, we know it’s a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so…
I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one
I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he’ll be there
I mean we never said this was exclusive
I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing
I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic
I mean, we're living in the moment
I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up
I mean, we still care about each other
I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her
I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful
I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever
I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it's weird
I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys
I mean, what about you
I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats
I mean, what am I gonna do without you
I mean what can we do
I mean, what- Chandler, look at that
I mean, what do you like, what don't you like
I mean, what else is it about
I mean, what if all we've got are
I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together
I mean what if this keeps happening
I mean, what if we're at her folks' place
I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us
I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it
I mean, what is that about
I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup
I mean, what's-what's the deal
I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are
I mean, what the hell is that thing
I mean, what the hell were you thinking
I mean, what was I hoping would happen
I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, (In a British accent
I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally
I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer
I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh…
I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced
I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know
I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather
I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie
I mean, who is Julie
I mean who needs a savings account
I mean, who’s-who’s to say
I mean, who would do that
I mean, why all the sudden are you so
I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future
I mean, why not
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip
I mean, why should I let them meet him
I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat
I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
I mean, women really like that
I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'
I mean, wouldn't you guys
I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip
I mean, would you… (He gestures and spills some of his coffee
I mean yeah, but only for three days
I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it
I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend
I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up
I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it (She grabs the rest of the pictures)…
I mean, y’know, I’m not really that comfortable dancing with a—(Treeger throws him) We-he
I mean y'know, I'm thinking
I mean, y'know, 's'Barry
I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing
I mean y'know, until you got cut off
I mean y'know, we haven't been going out that long
I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina
I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around
I mean, you and Ross
I mean, you can't tell me what to do
I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh
I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you
I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet
I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip
I mean you’d think he’d be worried about me not showing up at his club
I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off
I mean, you had a sketch
I mean you had just moved in
I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet
I mean, you hear such stories about New York
I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys
I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too
I mean, you know, we've never really talked
I mean, you know what that means
I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies
I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay
I mean, you listen to me
I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked
I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk
I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore
I mean you really kept Joey's underwear
I mean, you really thing this looks good
I mean, you're a sweeper
I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk
I mean, you're gonna have to try
I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again
I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly
I mean, you're married
I mean, you remember what it’s like to be eighteen years old
I mean, you're my
I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings
I mean you're right
I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note
I mean, you’re the one they’re gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex
I mean you’re-you’re beautiful and smart and sophisticated—a lot of this isn’t based on tonight
I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties
I mean you suck like you’ve never sucked before
I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer
I mean you totally cracked him
I mean, you two are-are my… I mean, I’m lucky to have just one good… (They all start getting emotional
I mean, you understand right
I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what
I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times
I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that
I mean, you won't even be here
I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down
I mean you, you, you, you must have lost like
I met Russ
I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was
I met this cute bridesmaid
I might actually get to play Ben's dad
I might have
I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours
I might know something
I might know something too
I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment
I might've said that
I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled
I missed you
I missed you too
I miss her
I miss, I miss the first time of everything
I miss Janice though
I miss my family
I miss my sexy voice
I miss Rose
I miss that dog
I miss that so much now
I miss the coffee house
I miss you already
I miss you buddy
I miss you to
I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
I moved back here a couple of months ago
I must have freaked out
I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet
I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight
I must’ve hit something on the remote
I must've left it in conference room B
I must’ve missed your call, even though I didn’t leave the flat all day
I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you
I need a couch that says, "Kids welcome here
I need a few more things to make the margaritas
I need change for the bus
I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man
I needed my lucky dress
I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village
I need help
I need juice
I need more swordfish
I need my toe
I need one fake ticket to Yemen
I need—(reaches for an instrument, Rachel's hand is on it) Excuse me, could I have this
I need some help
I need some milk
I need something I can really care about
I need something sweet
I need something that's more than a job
I need the juice
I need the meat
I need these hangers separated ASAP
I need to borrow some moisturizer
I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight
I need to get some gauze in here
I need to get some Richard
I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you (Points to Chandler) about, ‘cause you work for a big company
I need to relax
I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross’s sister Monica
I need to talk to her
I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is
I need to talk to you
I need to talk to you, it's urgent
I need two
I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist
I never called your mother a wolverine
I never did it
I never have to answer that phone again
I never knew that either
I never let her eat
I never meant for you to find out
I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper
I never should have broken up with her
I never would've
I notice that you’ve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities
I now find you shallow and um, a dork
I officially give up
I only had two glasses
I only hope my wedding looks this good
I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable
I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours
I over reacted
I overslept
I owe Rachel 20 bucks
I own this game
I packed while you were gone
I paid for those tickets
I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr
I personally could have a gallon of Alan
I physically hate him
I picked her
I pity the fool that
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do
I planned and I planned and I planned
I play Al Pacino's butt
I played bad on purpose guys
I play to win, alright
I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings (da-doom-chesh)
I process
I promise
I promise I'll pay you back
I promise we'll come up with something
I promise you, he would definitely want you back
I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you
I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling
I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you
I put it on to scare Chandler
I put my basket on top
I quit
I ran into Richard Dorfman
I read to you
I realise I don’t have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm, (Sees that Phoebe isn’t paying attention and is busy mimicking the puppy
I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it
I realize that people are going to be disappointed
I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do
I really am
I really appreciate this
I really appreciate this, y’know, but you don’t have to rub my butt
I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do
I really can't say
I really do
I really don't
I really don’t think it’s a very good idea, Phoebe
I really don't think so
I really don't want to mess up what we have
I really do, yeah
I really feel like I learned something
I really—I’m-I’m happ—I’ll work on it
I really like his glasses
I really like that bird though
I really like waking up with you
I really—(motions to Joshua
I really need to talk to you
I really need you guys right now
I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it
I really shouldn’t have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn’t cool
I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her
I really, thought that she was the one
I really thought you making a good point
I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can’t believe I missed it
I really wish you’d call me
I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there
I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it… (notices the look on Monica and Phoebe’s faces
I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother
I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody
I remember the day I got my first pay check
I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow
I remember when I first came to this city
I remember you did
I Ross
I rule all
I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud
I said art lover
I said, does anybody have a problem with that
I said, "Excellent butt, great rack
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn
I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking
I said I wanted it like Demi Moore
I said, "Like what
I said, mornin'
I said, "No
I said 'share' not 'scare'
I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her
I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces
I said that a little too loudly, didn't I
I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt
I said we are not going to do it, okay
I sang
I sat behind you guys in home room
I saved him
I saved you a seat
I saw a psychiatrist at work today
I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch
I saw her working on it this morning
I saw my name
I saw Richard
I saw that
I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge
I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool
I say always keep them running
I say, Drew
I say, 'I am there
I say, punch him
I say, punch him Joey
I say push her down the stairs
I say this year, no dates, we make a pact
I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares
I say we throw a surprise party this weekend
I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys
I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave
I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie
I say you show this guy what you're made of
I say you stand your ground
I scared ya, I knew it
I scared you
I see
I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right
I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing
I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever
I see how you did that
I seem to have had a slight office mishap
I see pizza
I see, Rachel's coming up the path
I see someone's having an allergic reaction
I see Spindler a lot
I see the head
I see your fifty cents
I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five
I sense these things
I shared my puddin’ which you man
I should be happy for them
I should get going
I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary
I should just be happy to be near you
I should never have married her
I shouldn’t have lied to him about having to work
I should really get back to work
I should run down say bye to him (runs out)
I should shave again, pick up some wine, what
I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me
I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil
I should've told you
I snapped, okay
I so am
I sold them all
I sort’ve already asked Chandler
I sound amazing
I so wanna be attracted to you
I spelled out boobies
I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me
I spent my whole life like that
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me
I spent the night out
I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball
I stalk guys and keep their underpants
I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake
I stayed at Kate's, but ah, nothing happened
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick
I still cannot believe you’re engaged
I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant
I still can’t believe they’re tearing it down
I still don’t get how you know when it’s false labour
I still don't get to see you
I still have your letter
I suck
I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling
I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her
I support you 100%
I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault
I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but
I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do
I suppose I’ve either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh
I suppose mainly sexual
I suppose there’s not much chance you did heard that, and there’s the call waiting so, I should go
I sure did
I sure do
I sure know how to pick 'em, huh
I survived college with him
I sw
I swear, I promise
I swear, I swear—(noticing Kristin's absence) How long has she been in the bathroom
I swear, I won’t say another word tonight
I swear I won't scratch
I swear to god, Dad
I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we
I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience
I swear you said you had the keys
I take credit for Paul
I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase
I talked to him today
I talked to Janice
I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come
I talk in my sleep
I talk to you and it's nothin'
I talk to you and nothin'
I taped oven mits to their hands
I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop
I tell people secrets
I tell ya a lot things
I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while
I tell ya, it’s a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder
I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy
I tell you, I've never seen him this happy
I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business
I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen
I tell you what, from now on I’m never getting out of this chair, ever
I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night
I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper
I think Barry is seeing someone in the city
I think he's a brown-nosing suck up
I think he's across the hall
I think he's baaad news
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball
I think he's drowning
I think he's right
I think he's shy
I think he's stealing from me
I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson
I think his butt would be angry here
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch
I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once
I think I blacked out there for a minute
I think I can come up with something better than that
I think I can explain this
I think I do
I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out
I think I got a shot at it
I think I have an old band uniform from high school
I think I just moved on to Phase Four
I think I just need lunch
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel
I think I know that girl
I think I left a donut up here
I think I like it better that way
I think I'll pass
I think I'm gonna be sick
I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while
I think I'm gonna take-off
I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover
I think I'm still in love with you
I think I need a drink
I think I saw Rachel out in the hall
I think I should stay, I think we should both know what’s going on
I think I strained my voice screaming in there
I think it has to do with my working late
I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better
I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope
I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable
I think it'll look good in our apartment
I think it makes you look really dangerous
I think it might be raining
I think it's about to attack the Enterprise
I think it's a great idea
I think it’s best that we just forget about it
I think it's going okay
I think it's great
I think it’s great
I think it's great you guys are doing this
I think it's insane
I think it's jaunty
I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don’t even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee—Oh no, have I said to much
I think it's nicer when people just get along
I think it's okay that we see other people
I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late
I think it's romantic
I think it's sexy
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen
I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital
I think it's winning
I think it went into me
I think it would be really good for you
I Think last night was great
I think maybe someone's lonely tonight
I think maybe, yeah
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like
I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that
I think my uterus just skipped a beat
I think once you're dead, you're dead
I think on my shoulder
I think on some levels she already knows
I think Rachel's here
I think Saturday—(groans in pain again)
I think she means (Imitates) 'You dance a dance class'
I think she's a blast
I think she’s here
I think she's OK
I think she took it pretty well
I think she would like that
I think so
I think somebody has a crush on somebody
I think somebody needs another lap dance
I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey
I think somebody should have it
I think some things are better left unsaid
I think so too
I think, sub-consciously…
I think that bitch cracked my tooth
I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him
I think that is so great
I think that's a little weird, y'know
I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died
I think that's the challenge
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers
I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process
I think the baby can totally hear everything
I think the baby kicked
I think the check in is that way
I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school
I think they get it
I think they're very nice
I think this can go somewhere
I think this could be the real thing
I think this could’ve be something really amazing, but y’know this is probably for the best
I think this is it
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple
I think this is so great
I think this will be fine
I think Ursula likes me
I think we all did
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here
I think we are, I think we are so on the right track
I think we can just leave it at that
I think we’d better start again
I think we have an answer
I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident
I think we proved our point
I think we're calling off the wedding
I think we're here
I think we should
I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up
I think we should let them win the next game
I think we've seen enough
I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off
I think what you have to do is try not to
I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot
I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind
I think you'd remember that
I think you have to draw him out
I think you killed us
I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is
I think you'll find this room more to your liking
I think you’ll like it, it has two out of the three tenors
I think you may have a drinking problem
I think you played the Gunther card too soon
I think your Dad must've added wrong
I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- (Realises)
I think you're better than you think you are
I think you’re done
I think you're great
I think you're my favorite
I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey
I think you’re right
I think you're very funny
I think you should definitely go out with this guy
I think you should drink the fat
I think you should go back with Gary
I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it’d be really good
I think you should stay away from him
I think you smell great
I think you’ve got concussion
I think you've gotta face it
I think you’ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India
I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in
I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back
I thought by the time
I thought he cut off his ear ‘cause he sucked
I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear
I thought it'd be great
I thought I told you not to come
I thought I told you to get outta here
I thought it was $98
I thought it was a key lime pie
I thought it was Chandler
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket
I thought it was like Long Island
I thought it was… quite tasty
I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder
I thought it went very well
I thought I was just one of the guys
I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn’t even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up
I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this (puts on her chef hat) on my chef’s hat
I thought I was making him filet mignon
I thought I would, but the translation's no good
I thought last night was great
I thought my number was up
I thought of a thing
I thought people were just bragging
I thought she just had one
I thought that movie was so incredibly
I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy
I thought that was a good thing
I thought that was an alp
I thought that was going to be romantic as hell
I thought that was just a rumour
I thought that was just what we called each other
I thought there wasn't a ball
I thought they could
I thought they’d brighten up the place
I thought this was going to be something we could do together
I thought this was, you know
I thought, uh
I thought we had a deal
I thought we have moved on
I thought we said seven
I thought we shared time
I thought we’ve gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other
I thought we were savin’ that for the Pope
I thought we were the patch sisters
I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money
I thought you could use the help
I thought you’d be out partying with Gandel-worf
I thought you didn't smoke
I thought you guys got married in uh, January
I thought you had this all planned out
I thought you had to do inventory all day
I thought you just really, really liked your new couch
I thought you knew that
I thought you meant in life
I thought you might be cold
I thought you only met him once
I thought your time ran out
I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you
I thought you said you read it in high school
I thought you wanted to adopt your cat
I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game
I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff
I thought you were Chandler
I thought you were crazy about her
I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today
I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me
I thought you were taking Ross to the game
I threw her at his man nipples
I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food
I told Emily to come
I told everybody about this
I told her
I told her "Hey
I told her I'd have to think about it
I told her I didn't want to get the part that way
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well
I told them to go easy on him
I told ya
I told you
I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right
I told you not to do that yet
I told you not to go down there
I told you there was going to be sub-titles
I told you we're Joanna's two assistants
I told you we wouldn't have to get up
I told you, you don't have to do that
I took a shot
I took her everywhere
I took these when I had my golfing accident
I totally don’t know what you’re talking about
I totally fit
I totally forgive you
I totally get symbolism
I tried
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer
I tried to stop, but I couldn't
I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you
I try to go four times a week, but I’ve missed the last 1200 times
I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right
I uh, don't really have a preference
I uh, I can't decide this
I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens
I uh, I got it from the gift shop
I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think
I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you’re interested, just as a thank you for this week
I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's
I uh, I’ve been to his apartment and he wasn’t there, and uh
I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person
I uh, went to a bar
I um, was sorta thinking about maybe
I understand
I understand that would be difficult
I understand the pain
I understand you had a little talk with Emily
I used it to buy all this stuff
I used them as mittens, I didn’t want to touch a thing in that last place
I used to babysit him
I used to be Bryce on All My Children
I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money
I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic
I used to have that bumper sticker
I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr
I wa-
I wa-I wa-I wa…
I wake up this morning, the stripper’s gone and the ring is gone
I walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop
I walked in there and she was all over me
I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back
I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian
I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun
I wanna be the on camera guy
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now
I wanna die
I wanna do this
I wanna get out of the room
I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing
I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him
I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side
I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one
I wanna hear everything
I wanna hear it
I wanna hear "The Sound
I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh
I wanna look nice
I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had
I wanna move in with you
I wanna quit the bank
I wanna quit the gym
I wanna say good-bye at the car
I wanna see this
I wanna see you take-off
I wanna show you something
I wanna sit in my chair
I wanna stay
I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend
I wanna talk about that interview
I wanna talk about this
I wanna talk to him
I wanna talk to you about something
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight
I want
I want a baby
I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts
I want a name that’s really like, y’know strong and confident, y’know
I want both of you out
I wanted to go to the strip club
I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure
I wanted to start drinking in the morning
I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day
I want her to think I might be in a restaurant
I want my cold back
I want my freedom
I want that place so much
I want the baby to know my voice
I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs
I want the little round waffles
I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion
I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like
I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma
I want to do this
I want to go home
I want to go on a ride along
I want to go to the bathroom
I want to keep one
I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer
I want to seize every opportunity
I want to sign that
I want to take my tongue
I want to talk to you about your review
I want you close enough to smell the blood
I want you Drake
I want you out
I want you right here, right now
I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you
I want your lips on me now
I want you there, I need you there
I want you to be my friend again
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in
I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours
I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands
I want you to like her
I want you to move in with me
I want you to say that you like her
I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new
I warned you
I was
I was able to appreciate it on another level
I was always Joanne
I was always Richie
I was always rooting for you two kids to get together
I was an idiot back then
I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me
I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today
I was awesome, ok
I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure
I was bluffing
I was buried in an avalanche
I was busy with the business
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you
I was Dr
I was fourteen
I was frustrated
I was frustrated with you
I was going for quiet desperation
I was going to call him, but…
I was going too
I was gonna do it
I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend’s
I was gonna say…
I was hoping to get to know you better
I was in charge of cups
I was in her ah, Home Ec class
I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat
I was in too much pain
I was, I was trying to save my sandwich
I was just
I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault
I was just being polite, but, alright
I was just curious
I was just flipping through the channels and bam
I was just going to get dressed
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group
I was just thinking
I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group
I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips
I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding
I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel
I was kinda using that machine
I was laughed out of twelve interviews today
I was laughing
I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky
I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window
I was looking for you before
I was not and oh God, shh
I was not flirting
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them
I wasn't around that much
I wasn't by myself
I wasn't expecting the machine
I wasn't faking
I wasn't- I mean, I-
I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either
I wasn't ready for it
I wasn’t sleeping
I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was
I wasn't thinking
I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car
I was passin' by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it's kinda cool seeing you up there
I was pretty good, huh
I was probably waiting for it to open
I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke
I was really impressed, I was
I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs
I was right
I was saving them for something special
I was saving up to buy a hamster
I was saving you
I was shrieking
I was so listening to that
I was so sure that was gonna work
I was stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old
I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago
I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago
I was supposed to meet her for lunch
I was Susie Underpants 'till I was 18
I was sweepin' yesterday
I was the Aramis guy
I was the James Michener of dirty talk
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo
I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in
I was there
I was thinkin' about it
I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter (Good for her) but… Okay, why not
I was thinking about how I let you down
I was thinking Chinese food
I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andy McDowell's new haircut
I was thinking of like a gravy boat
I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you
I was thrown out of a hotel
I was told she was
I was told you had a question
I was too busy fallin'
I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff
I was totally over the line
I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't
I was tryin’ to make a sale
I was uh, a little bigger then
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those…
I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily
I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it
I was wondering, please, if-if it’s not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please
I was working all day
I was wrong
I watched
I watched Monica bang his head against that thing
I wear it all the time
I went
I went back to Riff’s
I went down there just like you said, y'know
I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband
I went, I went after Ross in stupid London
I went really long
I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad
I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house
I went through this whole book (Holds up a book) and found nothing
I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made
I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back
I went with, uh
I wh-, what's wrong
I will
I will accept store credit
I will always have gum
I will find a selfless good deed
I will flip you for it
I will get that
I will give you a call
I will go for that drink
I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay
I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it
I will have one
I will have the uh, Cajun catfish
I will, I will
I will, I will get her phone number
I will kill you
I will not take this abuse
I will, really
I will replace it, I promise
I win
I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally—(opens envelope)—not worth it
I wish
I wish all guys could be like him
I wish I could
I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around
I wish I could know if you’d heard any of that
I wish I could take you home and see you everyday
I wish I didn’t have to go
I wish I had smoked for my career…
I wish I was
I wish she was my wife
I wish things were different, I
I wish we at least knew his name
I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up
I wish you hadn't seen me throw up
I won
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know
I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum
I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison
I wonder what he wants
I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket of porn…
I wonder where she is
I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her
I won't
I won't go back
I won't go back to that hell hole
I won't play anymore
I worked in a Dairy Queen, why
I work here
I work Monday nights
I would
I would be going out with all of you
I would be shopping
I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening
I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time
I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face
I would have to say no
I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket
I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can’t leave him
I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so…
I would like to donate $200
I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half
I would like to get her something serious
I would like to make a pledge
I would like to take you and your fear
I would love it if I weren't here
I would love it would be great if one of those was true
I would love to
I would love to do it together
I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next
