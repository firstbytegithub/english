She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked
She's a cyborg
She's already fluffed that pillow
She's always been a Freudian nightmare
She's amazing
She's a person, you can do it
She's a pet mortician
She's a stealer
She's a vegetarian
She's a waitress
She's back
She's bluffing
She's checking the coats
She's comin'
She's coming up
She's competitive
She's curator of insects at the museum
She's dating
She's dead
She's distraught
She's doing her laundry
She's finally full
She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes
She's going in
She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal
She's gone
She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it
She's gonna be helping me tonight
She's gonna break the pact
She's gonna make it on time
She's gorgeous
She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother
She's got her tongue in his ear
She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk
She's great
She's had the most amazing life
She's having lunch with him
She's having my baby and she's not here
She's holding the box between her cheek and shoulder) and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, (Pause) my body
She's insane, the woman is insane
She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning
She's like this high-powered, driven career type
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me
She's living with a woman named Susan
She's moving on
She's my best friend
She's my biggest fan
She's my ex-wife
She's my wife
She's not a bug lady
She's not a twinkie
She's not even here yet
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she
She's not here
She's not here yet
She's not much of a phone person
She's not my girlfriend anymore
She's not- past, she's present, she's back
She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel
She's not there anymore
She's not with anyone
She's on
She's one of us now
She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach
She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back
She's over on your side, cuddling
She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now
She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby
She's pretty cool
She's pretty, she's smart
She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up
She's really dull
She's really going to love this, you know
She's resting, which is a good sign
She's right
She's right in there
She's right, it's Jill
She's right y'know
She's smart and funny, y'know
She's so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class
She's still asleep
She's still with you
She's supposed to be very good
She's supposed to be with you
She's the actress who was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost
She's there
She's too much for me in bed
She's upstairs
She's waving me over
She's your partner
