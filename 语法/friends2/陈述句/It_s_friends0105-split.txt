It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly

It's perfect
It's Pete
It's petite
It's Phoebe
It's possible

It's so good, isn't it
It's so good that you had a good time in Greece
It's some of Richard's hair
It's so much bigger than the cubicle
It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know
It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask
It's sooo good
It's so sad
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family
It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear, in fact I hardly expected to see so much
It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab
It's starting to snow
It's still a gift
It's still going on
It's stuck
It's stuff like that, isn't it
It's such a beautiful morning
It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up
It's Sunday night, and he didn't call
It's supposed to be that small

It's this woman from work
It's throwing and catching
It's time for
It's time for me to conquer the physical world
It's time for my date with Joey
It's time for the good ice cream now, right
It's time to see your thing
It's time to start pushing
It's time to take the pin out
It's time to try peeing
It's tiny
It's too late
It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound
It's too scary

It's um the other thing
It's urgent
It's us
It's us versus them
It's Valentine's Day
It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse
It's very interesting, Phoebe
It's very sweet
It's very thougtful
It's very weird
It's watching Yasmine Bleeth run and is chirping
It's way to hot
It's wee
It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away
It's what grown-ups do
It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left
It's what's underneath her sweater that counts
It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller
It's wonderful
It's work
It's worse than the thumb
It's worth it, if it will get you moving
It's you
It's your call
It's your hair
It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue
It's your old friend Harry Elefante
It's your pro list
It's your thing, and-
It's your timer
