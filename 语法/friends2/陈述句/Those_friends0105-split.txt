Those are almost right on the floor
Those are dead serious
Those are good eyes
Those are snug
Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm
Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved
Those cute little black ones I wear all the time
Those guys will grab anything
Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor
Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn’t picture myself with any of them
Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy
Those were like the best seats ever
Those weren’t albino kids, that was computer camp
