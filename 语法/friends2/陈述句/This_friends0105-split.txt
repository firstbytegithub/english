This little, old lady lives for my career
This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that
This man is dying—(She is cut off by an exploding shell just outside the tent
This man is my God
This means a lot to me
This means something to me
This mink
This money is for the poor
This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment
This must be so hard
This must be very tough for ya, huh (and starts comfroting him looking for a kiss)
This must have cost him a fortune

This totally makes sense
This used to be your room
This was all your idea
This was great
This was just in case you pulled a Monica
This was just not worth it
This was nobody's first choice
This was not at all scary
This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment
This was supposed to be a temp job
This was your idea
This was your pact
This way I can break 'em up with a movie
This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger
This where they put it
This whole courtroom's out of order
This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me
This will be your phone
This will just be my batch
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home
This woman, Alison, from work
This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since
