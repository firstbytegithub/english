She absolutely loved me
She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia
She already lives in London
She also has a scowl on her face as she is ringing her bell
She also steals
She always drank it out of the can, I should have known
She answered
She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh
She barely knows me
She begins to scream at her husband
She bought a little leather jacket and a little cowboy outfit for the babies
She brings a mug to Monica
She broke my arm
She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see
She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story
She can barely hold back the tears
She can get me wherever I am
She can’t here you
She can’t wait
She comes to the table, lifts all the magazines and wipes under them, then just puts them down again
She could be giving birth in the cab
She could be you
She could work for you
She cried
She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna
She did
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat
She didn't even know that happened
She didn't feel anything for him
She didn't gossip at all
She didn't hang up either
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out
She didn't know,  how should I know
She didn't want me—not important
She doesn't know
She doesn’t know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy
She doesn’t want to see you ever again
She draws what looks like an airplane
She finds something that's Monica's and goes over and knocks on her closed bedroom door
She forced me
She forgot my vegetarian
She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker
She goes limp in his arms
She goes over and opens the door to reveal Rachel with her old nose
She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get
She had a more open, giving spirit
She hangs up her coat, revealing her new cardigan
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us
She has a real name
She has babies and dies
She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London
She has to know that your not ready
She hates him
She hears someone coming up the stairs and quickly puts down her magazine and pretends like she’s actually doing the dishes
She hired me because she thinks I’m good
She is a kook
She is finishing up writing something as Ross walks through the door
She is gonna hate me
She is having one of her boobs redused
She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again
She is not Rachem
She is now
She is on the phone]
She is pretty, huh
She is really hot
She is seeing off the last of the guests
She is so
She is so cute
She is so great
She is so hot
She is so peaceful
She is totally-(The gang enters behind Joey and Phoebe pinches him again
She is unbelievable, our mother is
She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in
She just called and said that she was gonna be working late
She just came in and gave him a hug, that it
She just took it really, really well
She just, you know, she’s always breaking my stuff
She keeps lying to me
She keeps squirming, trying to get away
She kept
She knocks on the door
She knows about us
She knows I can see her
She knows I'm home
She laughed at you
She left you umm, (looking in her purse) this lipstick
She lent me an egg once
She lent me the earrings, and I lost it
She lies down and rests her head in his lap)
She likes me best, and apparently there've been a lot
She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something
She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left
She lives so close
She looked right at me
She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all
She looks back
She looks great
She looks so small
She loved me
She loves you
She made the tea
She makes me happy
She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men
She may have died
She might be able to do better
She nailed it
She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over
She never tells us anything
She obviously didn't understand the question
She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left
She panics and throws the thing into the kitchen
She plays for both teams
She pops the top off and aspirins fly all over the place as Ross enters
She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas
She pulls a huge bathing suit out of a box] Hey, Mon, what is this
She puts down the phone
She quickly calms down
She quickly retreats back up the stairs
She really said that
She really wants to make up
She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche
She rocks
She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did
She said, "If I’m not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it
She said she'd call me
She said she’s having sooo much fun with Emily
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off
She said, "Thank you
She said that
She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual
She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back
She said what
She said yes
She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face
She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent
She says it has a weird smell
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase
She says there's a problem with the form
She scurries in and quickly drops a coin in the slot before Phoebe gets there
She seems fine now
She seems really great, but she’s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away
She seems so
She sees smart
She sells drugs to kids
She shifts a little bit and Ross suddenly gets an idea
She should be here by now
She should move here
She smiles and waves again
She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies
She starts to bark like a dog
She still flounders)
She stole
She stops and starts to look through a magazine and notices a squirrel on a nearby tree chirping at her
She suddenly stops reading and starts blinking her left eye as if it's bothering her
She takes a deep breath
She takes off her coat and heads for the kitchen
She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting
She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in Spaceballs, and mimic a conversation between the two of them
She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her
She thought you were cute
She thought you were somebody else
She threw things, they hit me
She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks
She told me you said you could really fall for her
She told us
She took me by surprise
She touched my bicep for crying out loud
She turns on the lights, and sits down on the couch
She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him
She wanted to call Bob
She wants me to move to London
She wants me to put lotion on her
She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship
She wants to know what's wrong
She wants to meet you in person
She wants to say hi
She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me
She wants to wear them tonight
She was
She was a cat
She was all over me
She was a showgirl
She was a welder
She was biting her lip to stop from screaming
She was horrible
She was in the Israeli army
She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking
She was kinda stupid
She was like, "Oh my god
She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body
She was more like, "I see you point, I’m all right with it
She was my best friend, you guys
She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two
She was not good
She was nothing compared to you
She wasn't a hooker
She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser
She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me
She was so spunky
She was totally at my mercy
She was very popular
She went like this
She what
She will kill you like a dog in the street
She would
