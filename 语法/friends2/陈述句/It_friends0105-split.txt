It all adds up
It bit
It bleats, in protest
It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch
It can with the pants
It certainly is a miracle
It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica
It coulda been me
It could be a guy
It could be better, but it’s gonna be okay, right
It could be like a big giant guy
It could happen
It could happen to anyone
It could take time to get a taxi
It could’ve been worse, he could’ve shot her
It creeps me out
It depends on who asked
It did at first, but not anymore
It did enter my mind
It didn't
It didn’t
It didn't look this big in the office
It didn’t mean anything
It didn't mean anything to me
It didn’t remind you of…
It disappears back there behind that baseboard
It does
It does in mine
It does not
It doesn't count
It doesn't even fit you anymore
It doesn't go with any of my stuff
It doesn’t happen to every guy
It doesn’t hurt that (tries to take a step) baaad
It doesn't matter
It doesn’t matter
It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head
It doesn't matter who knows what
It doesn't mean
It doesn't mean anything
It doesn't say that
It doesn't say that in the script
It doesn't scare me
It doesn’t seem desperate
It doesn't taste bad
It doesn't work, and without picking up the phone leans down to it
It does sound appealing
It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her
It feels funny just being here
It felt good to be out of the rain
It felt like a 'big guy' moment
It flushes it
It gives it a nice antiquey look
It got caught on my watch
It happened in London
It happened to me
It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life
It has been in my head all day long
It has the nail
It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building
It hurts
It is
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together
It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention
It is Judy
It is me
It is nice to meet you
It is nothing like the Hobbit
It is not over
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you
It isn't
It is off
It is okay, if I stay and watch
It is our first official date
It is raining out
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes
It is starting to get dark out there
It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate
It is true
It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size
It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this
It just doesn’t…feel like we’re breaking up
It just got interesting
It just keeps getting worse and worse
It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does
It just makes more sense as an ensemble
It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that…
It just seems so futile, you know
It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it
It kicked
It kicked once, it’ll kick again
It looked like an eight, alright
It looks great
It looks like a women's purse
It looks like her
It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal
It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down
It looks like Rachel’s gonna put on a skit
It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation
It looks really expensive
It made me nuts
It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish
It makes me ache, you know
It makes them like me
It means it's healing
It meant nothing
It must have cost you quite a few debloons
It never occured to anybody to bring another one
It only takes us two minutes to get dressed
It probably would've been the most constructive solution
It really and truly does
It really creeps me out choosing other people’s sex clothes
It really creeps me out when you call it that
It really does
It really hit me last night
It really is the most lovely building you’ll ever see
It really says that
It really was
It says D-13
It says here that the knife went right through your shoe
It says here that there’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums
It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did
It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened
It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish
It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item
It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common
It sounds familiar
It sounds really cool
It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice
It starts with Monica reading a newspaper to him
It still works
It still wouldn’t be clean
It sucks
It tastes good
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid
It turns into
It turns out that I’m not free tonight
It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her…
It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job
It uhh, it won't go back
It uh… It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed
It was
It was 5
It was a 50's theme restraunt
It was a big deal
It was actually the…
It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater
It was a long shot
It was amazing
It was an accident
It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose
It was an accident, I swear, all right
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes
It was a really beautiful service
It was a simple mistake
It was a stupid play anyway
It was bat day at Shea Stadium
It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head
It was breezy
It was Chandler's idea
It was comfortable, it was familiar
It was definitely Michelle
It was dreadful
It was either but or butter
It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like
It was fine, y’know
It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin
It was good, yeah
It was great
It was great meetin’ ya
It was her favorite book as a kid
It was him
It was his audition in the first place
It was incredible
It was in my room all night
It was, it was great
It was, it was her voice
It was, it was really nice
It was just a car backfire
It was just a dream
It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't
It was just four years of parties and dating and sex
It was just so awkward and bumpy
It was just so cool
It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop
It was like finding money
It was like months ago
It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man
It was like torture
It was like you were marking your territory
It was Max's stuff
It was Michelle
It was my credit card you were using
It was my first time
It was my first touchdown
It was my plan
It was my quarter
It was my racquet
It was nice
It was nice, nice
It was nice to meet you
It was nothin'
It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship
It wasn’t like that I
It wasn't so much a party as
It wasn't your whole toe
It was only seconds after Rachel pushed the call button was she there
It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in… (The duck quacks
It was pretty cool
It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before
It was really so thoughtful of you
It was really sweet
It was ridiculous
It was right after I slept with Joey
It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier
It was soo moving
It was soo not an accident
It was so wild
It was terrible
It was the best day
It was the first frost
It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard
It was this perfect evening
It was to be looked at, but never played with
It was totally flirting
It was unbelievable
It was very very good
It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow
It was, wasn't it
It was you, pal
It was your mother's idea
It went great
It went under the table
It will be fun
It will not be fine
It won't be long before your the boss
It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk
It won't come off
It won't hurt
It would be like this giant karmic debt
It would be so cool to live across from you guys
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out
It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name
