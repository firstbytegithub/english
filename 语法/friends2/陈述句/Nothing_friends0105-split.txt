Nothing at all
Nothing for you, you have Paolo
Nothing happened
Nothing I do means anything, really
Nothing I uh, it’s just that I know that they’re still out there
Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up
Nothing nothing nothing
Nothing rhymes with your stupid name
Nothing to see here
Nothing wrong about that
