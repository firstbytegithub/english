He actually has everything
He also found an 'M' and an 'O'
He always ridiculed my pottery classs
He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened
He answers it to see a young woman holding a fishtank
He asked you out
He bangs on the door)
He beat ya
He bends over to pick it up and gasps
He broke that
He broke up with Julie
He called me young lady
He called to ask out Monica
He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic
He can get really competitive
He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean
He cannot come
He cannot do this to Phoebe
He can not persue this
He can press her up against that window as much as he wants
He can still catch her
He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen
He can’t see us
He carries a briefcase
He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret
He closes the door and they start kissing
He comes to what he thinks is the right one and knocks on it
He could be a Glen
He could hear me
He could never get a woman like that in a million years
He couldn't even tell me
He could row like a viking
He crumpled like a piece of paper
He cut off his ear
He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision
He did it
He did my first suit when I was 15
He didn't blink or anything
He didn't get the goggles
He didn't have any
He didn’t say anything about no strippers
He didn’t turn me down
He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up
He does
He does look like him though
He does not look happy
He doesn't do much, does he
He doesn't have anyone
He doesn't have rabies, he has babies
He doesn't like how it tastes
He doesn’t make any noise
He doesn't see Eddie so he enters, breathing a sigh of relief
He does that
He dumped me the next day
He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it
He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me
He finally asked you out
He finally chooses the one his right and goes in
He forgot to leave his grip size
He found me
He gave me a pill for it
He gets out of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple of cabs
He gets up and puts on a nametag that says Ross, but doesn't quite like it
He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt
He goes over and opens it
He goes up to her
He got phased out
He got so sad
He got to do it at your first wedding
He got to spend the whole day with you
He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea
He had to go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard
He happens to be brilliant
He has a naked picture of Monica
He has a name, it’s Dragon
He has a name, okay
He has dragged Rachel along for the trip, and she's not too happy about it
He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang
He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out
He hasn’t gotten out of that chair in two days
He hated us
He hates it
He hates me
He he touches himself when nobody's watching
He hooked up
He hooked up with someone
He is
He is awaken by the phone
He is extremely wired
He is getting on the jetway
He is going to marry that other girl
He is right, isn’t he
He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate
He is so amazing
He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom
He is so cute
He is so great
He is so much cooler than our dads
He is soo unreasonable
He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD
He is supposed to be here
He is telling her about her mascara problem
He is trying on a pair of pants
He just balled up socks
He just comes in here, Mr
He just got a divorce right
He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts
He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park
He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking
He just lopped it right off
He just makes it up
He just met him
He just needed his pal to come home
He just said my name
He just said, "No strippers
He just told me at the counter
He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before
He keeps shutting me out, y'know
He kept asking me about chicken
He kept my dollar
He kinda did it to himself
He knew
He knew we were trying to get rid of him
He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way
He likes you
He listens at the door
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown
He looks like he just woke up
He looks pretty mad
He looks so tiny
He loved the Civ)l War
He loves this
He loves you
He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer
He means nothing to me
He musta been sweepin'
He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide
He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort
He obviously lost his mind
He obviously went crazy
He only tipped like four percent
He paid a lot of money for it
He painted that
He paints quite a picture doesn't he
He performs emergency surgery, then hands the doll back to J
He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it
He picks it up and eats it
He pooped in my shoe
He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job
He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs
He pulled himself up
He puts his headphones back on
He quit for me
He realizes what he said
He remembered
He removed my mole cluster
He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together
He rolls over and is shocked to see Janice there
He said bye
He said he'd call
He said he'll call
He said, he said that they're having a great time
He said he's really gonna miss you guys
He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite--
He said it was just some sort of skin
He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda
He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student
He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah
He said that he wasn’t gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he’s gonna do is have you evicted—I’ll see you later
He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la
He said this is what you guys do
He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right
He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom
He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies
He seemed so mad at me
He seems to think we’ll be able to find a new place for the wedding
He shot a bird
He should not get back together with her
He should take the sack
He showed me where the restaurant's going to be
He sounds like a nice, good guy
He spun me
He started it
He started mine first
He starts to get flustered
He still hasn’t called
He stopped by
He takes naked pictures of us
He tells the most racist jokes
He then looks up at an empty apartment; everything is gone except for the entertainment center and that ceramic dog
He then runs into a tree at the end of the field
He thought you said gonad
He throws a bunch into the mailbox, but pauses with Rachel's
He throws his bag down and sits down on one of the leather chairs, but he sits on something and picks it up and throws it away
He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything
He told me in person
He told on us
He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out
He took my essence
He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything
He tosses some forms onto reception desk
He touched my fanny
He tries to just sit on it normally, and then he tries flopping on it
He turns around, shocked
He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose
He types for a little while, opens the drawer again, and takes another drag of the cigarette
He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting
He used to lock himself in the basement for hours
He viscously screamed at total strangers
He wakes up with a start and has one of the pages of the letter stuck to his face
He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again
He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more
He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible
He wants to talk to you again
He was a big guy
He was fine
He was having sex with Amy Welch
He was here just a moment ago
He was just drooling all over you
He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something
He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-
He was more embarrassed about that than anyone
He was Paolo's cat
He was right
He was supposed to type "little", the idiot
He was unbelievable
He was with her when he wrote this poem
He was you're health teacher
He watches Jeopardy
He went crazy
He went out for groceries
He went to get lotion
He will, Joe
He winces and pulls his hand away
He won't
He works in a museum
He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring
He wouldn't have made it
He would say, "See you ladle
He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design
