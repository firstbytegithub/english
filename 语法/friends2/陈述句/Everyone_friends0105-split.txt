Everyone but Chandler is there
Everyone but Joey and Monica are there
Everyone calm down
Everyone else is already there
Everyone except Ross is there watching Days of Our Lives
Everyone exept Phoebe and Chandler is there
Everyone has left, except for the gang
Everyone in the hall outside Mr
Everyone is outside knocking
Everyone is sitting around
Everyone is sitting at the couches, Chandler enters
Everyone is there
Everyone is there except for Phoebe, Ross, and Susan, who are in the broom closet
Everyone knows who you are
Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is
Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'
Everyone thinks they know me
Everyone wants to have a green one
Everyone was so, so nice
