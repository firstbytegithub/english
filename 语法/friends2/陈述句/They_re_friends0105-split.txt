They're as different as night and
They're at the nurses' station
They're both gorgeous and sexy
They're brother and sister
They're craaazy
They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow
They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow
They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds
They're gonna call her Chandler
They're gonna do it together
They're here already
They're identical
They're Joey's
They're just staring at him in shock
They're just trying to decide somehting
They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that
They're made of wicker
They're male nurses
They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots
They're nice guys
They're not coming on man
They're not even paying ya
They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning
They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go
They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King
They're putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel's gonna film it
They're ribbed for your pleasure
They're so small
They're still in my coat
They're still in their chairs watching TV
They're still just friends, right
They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste
They're still watching TV
They're supposed to give me away and everything
They're takin all my stuff back
They're trying to mess with us
They're trying to take Joey
They're walking away
They're your backup singers
They're yours
They're your underwear
