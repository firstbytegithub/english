These are fantastic
These are from Halloween three years ago
These are her earrings
These are my night vision goggles
These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's
These are not
These are pure vodka
These are sooo comfortable
These are the headlines on the day you were born
These are, these aren't for you
These got left for ya
These hands
These look the same
These miracle, magical, life-giving hands
These new kids, they never last
These old things
These pants are burning up
These people'll scooch down
These things keep falling down, I can't
These things, they happen for a reason
These tiny, little non-breasts
