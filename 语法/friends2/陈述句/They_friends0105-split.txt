They actually said that
They all had a thing for him
They already do
They already live together, why do they need to get married
They are
They are both clutching the covers in from of them
They are carrying boxes
They are gonna love me
They are hauling out the porcelain dog from Joey's room
They are having their party
They are just silly
They are now fighting about what Rachel told Van Damme
They are sitting on the couch watching a movie
They are still in their chairs, watching Beavis and Butthead
They are watching a Miracle Wax info-mercial
They baked it
They both start to strike a pose with the excessive amount of pictures that Monica takes
They called and you didn't get it
They call me
They cannot get enough
They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son
They couldn’t be worse
They couldn't hit a boat if
They dash up to the admissions desk
They did it right there on the couch
They didn't even talk to each other
They didn't fight a lot
They do
They do don’t you think
They do me
They don't
They don’t have those
They don't know that we know they know we know
They don’t look any bigger than me
They don’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff
They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff
They don't serve donuts
They don't want the bad publicity
They do that a lot
They enter and are played by Noah Wyle and George Clooney
They even came with a list of baby names
They even do you
They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there
They found a broom in his hand
They found rust
They gave me the shaft all right
They get the apartment back
They get to be pretty loud so Chandler turns the TV way up
They give you all the information, it’s uh, it’s like memorizing a script
They got a breakfast buffet
They got a phone in there, right
They gotta be Joey's
They guys are sitting there like the Three Monkeys
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum
They have a kid together, y'know
They have another guess
They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close
They haven’t even slept together yet, I mean, that’s not serious
They haven't quite taken yet
They have racquets don't they
They have really lax security there
They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday
They just think you're a little
They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done
They know you know
They let the players run the team
They like me more just because I was with ya
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them
They make you take an oath
They musta read the sonogram wrong
They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese
They never cover me
They never would have survived in the wild
They published my paper
They put that in
They really got you guys
They really were pretty, weren’t they
They require constant care
They rushed into this thing so fast it’s ridiculous
They said, "If I bothered them again they’d call the police
They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book
They said they’re gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders
They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being
They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger
They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be
They shouldn’t be living in an apartment
They spent $69
They still say you're a great boss
They still want me for General Hospital
They suck
They suck, alright
They swoop in and steal your jackpot
They take like dogs and cows
They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits
They threw us out
They took Ben to the park
They torn it down a few days early
They uh director
They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over
They walk away from each other
They wanna know if I'm okay
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it
They were at a table previously
They were huge
They were in his office
They were like this
They were nice
They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that
They were threefold
They won't all be like this
They won't take her back
They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun
They wouldn’t give me her real name or her number
They wouldn’t have put it there if it didn’t do something
They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it
They would use it to get the mud off their shoe
