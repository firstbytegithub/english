To be fair, he doesn’t seem to be impersonating Fonzie…
To be nice
To Chandler) Look at him
To get my coat
To have had a friend like you
To her face
To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me
To London
To me that's nice
To pay for the gym
To Put the Camera Away
To record a message begin speaking at the tone
To score the winning touchdown, by the way
To take more pictures of all of us together
To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move
To the bank
To the green
To the left, to the left- aww
To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better
To what
To yourself
