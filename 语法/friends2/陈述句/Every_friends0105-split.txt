Every day is Lesbian Lover Day
Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother
Every moment is precious
Every night
Every office in the world uses that program
Every thing's--they're fine
Every time
Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting
Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her
Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey’s apartment
Every year
Every year, all right
Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks
