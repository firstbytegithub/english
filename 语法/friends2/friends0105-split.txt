And hey
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas
And hey, it’s cool if you’re a lesbian
And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can
And his first name
And his puppet too
' and holds up her thumb
And Hornswoggle
And how come you never said anything to me
And how was the date
And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy
And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know
And I am getting it back right now
And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays
And I brought Operation
And, I came up with Atlantic City
And ice
' and I'd be okay
And I definitely would get the part if I would've
And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married
And I do have one seat left
And I do, I have to make this marriage work
And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again
And I don’t even have a date
And I don't even know how it happened
And, I don’t know, if it starts to rain…
And I don't think I'm gonna want to
And I don’t want to live with some one who doesn’t know what it is to be a friend
And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy
And if, and if you don’t understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn’t get married at all
And I feel horrible
And I feel like I've conquered the business world, and I feel like I've conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world
And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them
And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out
And if I don't get it, (pause, picks up the duck) I'm gonna shoot this duck
And if I had too, I’d pee on anyone of you
And I finally get my shot, and I blow it
And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket
And if it doesn’t mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you’re just an idiot in a box
And if it makes you feel any better, I’ve had a really lousy day
And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater
And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses
And if I want to call for a reference on your last job
And I fixed it
And if she didn’t take it, and I didn’t take it; and you (Chandler) didn’t take it, then who did
And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad
And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it
And if you need anything else, I—(notices the handsome Dr
And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to… (Ross interrupts and shushes her
And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing
And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe
And I got it on sale, too
And I got nauseous
And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees
And I gotta pay rent
And I got the duck totally trained
and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you
And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know
' and I hated that guy
And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb
" and "I have no Macys info
And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you
And I have to warn somebody, alright
And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule
And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba
And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor
And I-I am just trying to figure out why
and I-I can't take it
And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to
And I-I-I would’ve told you about it, but I didn’t know they would be here
and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me
And I-I know someday this will happen for you too
' And I, I looked at her
And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but—I'm sorry
{And I just can't hide it
' And I just kept thinking
And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it
And I just want a million dollars
And I just want it to be perfect and right and
And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor
And I know he only knows the bad words
And I know how hard it must have been for you to find
and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life
And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite
And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me
And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield
And I'll fit you for a glass eye
And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run
And I'll make you favorite dinner
and I'll raise you
And I'll tell you something else
And I love the milk
And, I love you
And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool
And imagine that you’re with Ross okay and imagine that you’re kissing him
And I’m a good chef, and I don’t deserve to have marinara sauce all over me
And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide
And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition
And I'm an orthodontist
And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually
And I'm a vegetarian
And I'm a wuss
And I may only have a couple beers in me, but
And I'm bleeding
And I’m cute too
And I mean, the connection, I mean y’know, emotionally, mentally, physically…
And I’m going to go get drunk
And I'm guessing
And I’m happy for ya, but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine
And I'm in it
And I’m just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be
And I’m not gonna be, so you can save you little speech
And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine
And I'm not happy about you either
And I'm not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me
And I'm okay with that
And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out
And I’m sad
And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand
And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me
And I’m so surprised
And I’m sure we’re all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall
And I'm sure you're gonna make a big impression
And I’m telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand
And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing
And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy
And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die
And in fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat"
And in London
And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage
And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived
And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice (pause) butt
and I raise you
and I raise you twenty
And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem
and I really think it should be me
And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle
And I say (Hits him) 'no
And I say 'your work
And is he-
And I still have about five seconds to spare
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that
And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel
" And it came out, "Squatternut buash
And it can't be Joey
And it could've just as easily have been a bullet
And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War
And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad
And I tell ya something
And it goes like this
And I think he really happens to like me
And I think I'm doing better
And I think it would bother a lot of people
And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone
And I thought it was a really good idea
And I thought things were going to work out for him
And I thought was a good idea so, I took it
And it is a big deal
and it kinda knocked me out a little
And it never hurts to wear tight trousers
And it’s against my oath as a masseuse
And it’s all because of you, wonderful, amazing you
And it's as handy as it is becoming
And it's engraved too, check it out
And it’s gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out
And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on
And it's not even born yet
And it's not even for me
And it's not just chicks y'know
and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know
And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit
And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah
" and it's signed, Joey 629-9*** (The last couple of numbers have been ripped off)
And it starts another round of clips
And it starts right now
And it’s y’know, it’s kinda like…
And it takes him, what
And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class
And it was just this raw, animal, sexual
' And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all over my life, ya know
And it wasn’t a hop it was a pademarie
And it works both ways
and I, uh
and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh
And I've never seen you this happy
And I've seen her be a little too into her looks
And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics
And, I wanna meet your parents
And I wanted to give it up I just—I didn't know what it was
And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour
And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty (counts his money) seven dollars
And I was filled with this-this great respect for life
And I was gonna go over and say ‘hi
And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage
And I was tired from digging the huge hole
And I will be teaching acting for soap operas
And I would have to say pah-huh
And Joey
And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses
And Joey knows
And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me
And just keep running
And, Kristin, Kristin
And last but not least
And listen, hey
And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday…
And look, and it’s-it’s purple
And look where they're sitting
And love
And lucky means, more cleavage
And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily
And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, (Joey stands up
And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again
And Merry Christmas from you’re secret Santa
And Milton Berle has a…
And Mindy, your maid of
And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know
And, Monica help me out here
And Monica knows
And Monica, with that snort when she laughs
and Mrs
And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it
And my second grade teacher was Ms
And my team always wins
and naked
And no one talks like that
And no one touches the air around the TV
And no one touches the TV
And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something
And not in a good way
And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too
And not just 'cause I have to
And not just for her
And not-not in a good way
And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love
And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too
And not the part that makes me do this
And now for the great news
And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV
And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept
And now I can work for you
And now if it's possible I think I love you even more
And now I have seen her naked
And now I have to get a snake
And now I know
" And now I’m at the front with Ross
And now it's, and now it's gone and I don't know why
And now it's just
and now, now, now you're over me
And now the coffee—ahh
And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop
And now there's no juice
And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore
And now we're back
And now, y'know, I'm like
And now you're choking
And now you’re giving me the message
And of course, the Indians
And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani
And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song
' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good
And "Oh no
and- oh, teams played sports
And, oh, the job is perfect
And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker
And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card
And okay, you guys (She turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something woman, who're a couple
And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit
And once again she is out of here
And one thing led to another and (He puts his leg on the chair and pulls up his pants leg to reveal that he now has shaved legs
And on my way over here, I stepped in gum
(And on the "I" part she mimics poking her eye
And on your anniversary, for shame
" And other stuff like that
And over there, that's the other one
and penache
And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises
And Phoebe, (pause) is on this couch
And plus, it'll give me something to do
' And pretty soon you'll be like, (sadly) 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there
And processing
And Rachel
And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me
and Rachel keeps touching him
And Rachel's in the bathroom
(And Rachel slowly closes the door, sadly
And Rach, I…I survived
And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring
And Ross
And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back
And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word
And runs to the couch as Ross enters
And second, say it don't spray it
And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people
And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye
And she hasn’t been home all night
And she is my girlfriend
And she just gave you this
" And she’ll go, "No-no-no, it’s Chandler
and she quickly closes it again
" And she said, "Thank you
And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica
And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years
And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about
" And she’s gonna say, "I love you, too
And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little…
And she's not crazy
And she’s picked up like nine new ones
And she's really pretty
And, she wants to do a video
And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then
And smart
And so
and so complicated
And so is the pirate
And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field
And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice
And some biscotti cookies
And somebody took a shot at me
And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account
And, some of it is not even popped
And some of us really have to pee
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this
And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right…
And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they’ve done and they’re call the whole thing off
And so now you guys are gonna be married
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket
And so then I realized
And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution
And soup
And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath
And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation
and special occasions
And staying still is good
And stop saying that
And sweetie
And tell them what
And thanks again
And, thanks for being so nice
And thanks Joey she's having a really great time
And thank you for giving it to me
And thank you, for that
And thank you so much for coming
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law
And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend
And that one—Dude
And that's bad because
And that’s funny, why
And that’s having a baby
And that's how you bought it
And that’s not against your oath
And that's Pete's Mom
And that’s-that’s a different kind of dream
And that's, that's funny why
And that’s the Chrysler Building right there
And that’s Wednesday
And that's what's gonna kill me
And that's when I knew
And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald
And that's why…
And that’s why I’m leaving
And that's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink
And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me
And that takes what
And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun
' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do
…and that was all before 10 o’clock
And that wasn't fun for you
And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me
And that would be
And that would be a shut-down
And the
And the baby's at zero station
and the bansai's and the chiuaua
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas
And the chairs can face this way (Points), and… (Points to Ross) You go
And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right
And the chicken poops in her lap
And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter
And the fact that they're both monkeys
And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting
And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind
And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go
And the guys from work had a blast
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave
And the Knicks rule all
And the lightning round begins—stop it (Chandler stops jumping)—now
And the man who made all this possible
And the moment of joy is upon us
And the musicians, look, they can go over here (Points to a little alcove), okay
And then
And then act aloof
And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her
And then after that, I’m gonna get so drunk, I’m gonna wanna call Janice
And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed
And then, and then, you turn to me and say, “Nah, let's just hang out at your place
And then by the time you get home tonight, you’re done
And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer
And then he burst into flames
And then he did
And then he eats chicken and looks at them
And then he said that- you said you thought
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't
And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff
and then he wouldn’t even talk to me any more
And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you
And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me
And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones
And then I just uh, just walked around for a while
And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store
And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this
And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home
And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again
And then I say, wait, here's my line, [Joey from TV] you know that's bad fo r the paper tray
And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives
and then it got canceled
And then, I tried to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off
And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore
And then Joey remembered something
And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword
And then my mom wants to know-(notices Joey)-Joey, what are you doing
And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like
And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it
" And then, "Oh my God, I’m so surprised—good-bye
And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life
And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around
And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were
And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross
And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal
And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don’t know what happened there either
And then Ross’s new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head
And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach
And then, she disappears… But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy
And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding
And then the florist phoned to say there aren’t any tulips
And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair
And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her
And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible
…and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me
And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair
And then Tineals
And then we could double date
And then- we just get nothing back
And then we throw your body in the water
And then we've gotta get some sleep
And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool
And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick
And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair
And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal
And then where're you gonna run
And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked
And then you lose your apartment
And then you lose your job
And then you put your arms around me
And then you realised if you (Points at Rachel) bitched about it, then you (Points to herself) would stop cooking, and you (Points at Rachel) would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke
And then your ex-wife gets married so fast
And then you rollll a-way
And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it’s some kind of grease, it’s—uck
And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it
And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice
and then Zana, just let one rip
And the one person I want to the most
And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right
And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend
And the reason why she couldn’t, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her
And there is Kevin
And there it is
And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like
And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you
And there's a thermos in it
- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account
And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so
And there's nobody to hug
And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just
And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'
And the response I got
And there's really no reason he should find out, so ah let's not make a big deal about it, okay
And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff
And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken
And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot
And the robe is lost
and the running
And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun
and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus
And the sex
And the spitting
and the style number, and the invoice number, and the shipping date
And the table is mine
And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook
And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox
And the thing that started it all, the cup
And the two times we went out were just plain awkward
And the video camera
And the way they play with your mind
And the winner gets a hundred bucks
And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women
And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it
(And they all high-five each other
" And they are
And they hate squirrels
And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much
And, they’re gonna have a baby
And they're off
And they're, they're running around on the deck
And they're very hot
And they stole—you stole it—our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice
And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus
And they weren't looking at you before
And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end
and thirteen months
And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message
And this alarm started going off in my head
And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big
And this from the cry-for-help department
And this goes for all guys
and this guy--
And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym
And this is my friend Phoebe
And this- is my reward
And this is my wife Kara
And this isn't Rachel's fault
And this is Rachel
And this manchild has no problem with how old you are
And this one—(Grabs the other hand
And three (holds up a third finger), it hurts
And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet
And tighty-whiteys
And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe
And twenty-five it is
And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn’t wear a cup
And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering
And, uh, and then I kissed her
And, uh, by the way
And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis
And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape
And, uh, I got this blouse for mom
And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella
And uh, I paid for the other half
And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it
And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head
And uh, Liam, Liam’s got bad knees
And uh maybe you have to get used to it
and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross
And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair
And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back
And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team
And, uh, the answer would be (Writes YES on the board) yes
And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out
And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character
And uh, (to the stripper) so is the position of the bride
And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this
And uh, which-which room might that be
And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace
And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to
And um, and there's actually a, a woman
And um, excuse me, he helps me
And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it
And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening
And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious
And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van
And umm, would you, would you give Lilly that, please
And um, what-what is that Ross
And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over
And upon seeing her condition, she says…) Oh no
And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out
and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too
' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude
And was it your idea to postpone the wedding
And was the curse lifted
And weddings are happy occasions
And we did
And we don't work hard
And weenie number two has it
And we just get along really well, and he's so cute
And we just sit here
' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years
And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew
And, well, now, I love Mockolate
And, well, Wendy's more of a
And well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore
And well, what did she say
And we're changing
And we're dancing
And we're done with the chicken fried rice
And, we're done with the yogurt
And we're going out again tomorrow
And we're not a couple of suckers
And we're not supposed to ask
And we should be partners
And we stayed up all night talking, and now we're like totally crazy about each other
And we talked business
And we’ve tried everything, we’ve seen a bunch of doctors
And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy
and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh
And what
And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me
And what did he say
And what did you bring
and what do I learn
And what do you call that
And what do you mean you never have fun anymore
And whatever you say, I'll believe ya
And what is, and what is all this
And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed
And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him
And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer
And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous (Holds her hands far apart) or very (In a high pitched voice) stingy
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there
And where is your hat
And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier
And where's this money coming from
And where the hell is all of our stuff
And where-where's the other one
And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar
And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants…
And while we’re down at the video store, you know what else we could rent
And while we're on the subject of news
And who do you like
And who is this guy
And who is this little cutie pie
And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man
And who laminated it
And who may I say is calling
And who pays for that
And why do you care so much
And why not
And why-why don’t you go down and get us a table
And why wouldn't he get it
And with Chandler in the next room
And ya know what, now I've got closure
andybody, anybody else there
Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR
And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country
And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great
And yet, believable
And yet it did
And yet, she's still not hanging up the phone
And yet somehow we went through five
And yet, we're still poking him
And yet you're surprisingly upbeat
And y'know, and um, I
And y’know, if you wanna cry, that’s okay too
And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and
And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats
And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway
And y’know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so…
" And y'know what
And y’know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you
And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio
And y’know what I’m gonna do as my first act as your best friend
And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn’t even try
Andy McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes

And you call yourself an accountant
And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger
And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too
And you can see me
And you can't even do that right
And you'd get all the votes
and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple
And you don't a little good about donating the money
And you don't have to be too emphatic about this
And you don't think taking care of our chick is work
And you feel like we hold you back
And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place
And you got a 'hate' from that
And you got a petticure
" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud
And you had no idea they weren't getting along
And you hate fish
And you have a customer
And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus
And you have these three great kids
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe
And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic
AND YOU KNOW
And you know it
And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us
And you know what
And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song
And you know what I did
And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day
And you know what the funny thing is
And you know which one we should see
And you know why
And you know why, because I make very bad decisions
And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard
And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man
And you never knew she was a lesbian
And your also bad in bedd-edd-edd
And you’re afraid you won’t be able to…fill his shoes
And you’re cute too
And you're going into what grade
And you’re going to remember all of the bad things about him
And you're gonna make them all disappear
And you're gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will
And you're like…y'know
And you're not gonna do that
And you're not supposed to be gossiping
And you're okay with that
And you're our age
And you're Rachel Green
And you're so sweet
And you're still not attracted to him at all
And you’re welcome to come back anytime
And you’re-you’re running your hands all over his body
And your fly's still open
And your friend Phoebe
And your license expired
And your like 'Mom, get outta here
And you said it was gonna be fun
" And you said, "No
and you sand it and you varnish it
And you should hold out for something bigger
And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job
And you squeezed it, so tight
And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers
And you the deal on Santa Clause right
And you've got lenses
and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine
And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen
And, you would die
And, you wouldn’t have to worry about the salmonella
And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles
And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy

But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies
But he has to know how I feel
But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident
But, he loves Emily
But he’s falling in love with her
but he's just phoning it in
But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it
But, he told me over the phone
But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything
But hey, I can be a kook
But hey, I know we can decide
But hey, it’s not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together
But hey, it's over now, right
But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you
But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she
But hey, Ross, this place is available now
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary
But honey he calls everybody by a nickname
But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and
But I
But I…
But I already gave them back to you
But, I already told Mr
But I also believed her (points to the phone) when she said I was next
But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing
But I can
But I can see through your sheet
But I can't tell you
But I counted, you're not supposed to live here
But I didn't
But I do know that it’s some time tomorrow
But I do not want to have everything decided for me
But I don't
But I don't know it
But, I'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell
But if
But if (Grunts uncomprehensively)……I mean, I mean like craaaazy
But if I can’t, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled
But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there
But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything
But if she doesn’t call, it is definitely over
But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend
But if there was something you wanted to tell us, we’re just gonna be right over there (points to the counter) having coffee
But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home
But if we win, we get your apartment
But if would’ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn’t have worried about it so much
But if you don’t come back soon, (She leaves and closes the door) there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it
But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross"
But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary
But if you have to ask
But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life
But if you weren’t my best friend
But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved
But I guess it was just the coma
But, I guess that's normal
But I guess that's the fun
But I had too
But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn’t mean that-that I’m still in love with him
But I haven't used my card in weeks
But I have to tell him how I feel
But I-I can't stay here just for you
But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am
But I-I-I have had it up to here
But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college
But, I just cleaned the bathroom
But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat
But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it
But I just wa
But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend
But I know I'm not afraid to do this
But I left in the Ys
But I like it here
But I’ll tell you something
But, I love you
But I'm--
' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live
But, I'm all right
But, I mean, do you think he's gonna enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away
But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in
But I'm gonna be there
but I'm hoping (gestures) huh-huh
But I’m-I’m done now
But I’m just doing it for you guys
But I'm not
But I'm not gonna do that
But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore
But, I’m not gonna serve the lasagna
But, I’m not gonna some British girl to move in with me
But I'm not gonna take anymore crap
But I'm not sure, Chandler
But, I’m sure they’ll come back when we can do it right
But I'm the host
but I'm thinking
But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets
But I need it
But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God
But, I need your germs
But, I never left the room
But in very different ways
But in your case it's actually kinda true
But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can't breathe
But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing
But I really like this guy
But I remember people telling me about it
But I saved it
But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn’t it
But it absolutely didn’t
But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting
But it didn’t
(but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist)
But I think we'd like to give poker another try
But, I think you’re absolutely delicious
But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher
But I thought you wanted to live by yourself
But it is a big deal
But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man
But it is our apartment
But it-it kinda got erased
But it just feels like--
But, it opened really hard
But it’s absolutely your decision
But it’s actually for Joshua
But it's available now
But it's dark out
But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear
-but, it's fine
But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour
But it’s just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia
But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know
But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk
But, it’s not like we’re losing anything
But it's not obvious why
But, it's not raining
But it's okay, I'll just put out pickles or something
But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message
But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit
But it's Ross
But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day
But it's the same
But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross
But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny
But it was a first for the rest of my building
But it was going to be really good
But it was pretty weird
But, it was stupid
But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea
But, I was curious; do you have any plans for tonight
But I was Dr
But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that
But I was, I was drunk on you
But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse
But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow
but I won't
But I won't have aged at all
but Joanne loved Chachi
But Joey, you're gonna be fine
But just a little one
But just as they reach the landing they see Danny out in the hall talking to a guest, Rachel then quickly pulls Monica back up the stairs
But just one last thing
But like a really tough one that shots bad guys
But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK
But look, all these rooms are fine okay
But look how much they spent
But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch
But look--I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that
But, Malcom sees her
But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it’ll die
But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better
But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit
But Mon, you have to get our money
But my birth mom did
But my clothes are—ohh
But my mom always makes them
But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago
But no
" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time
But, no, I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to like all my gods
But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place
But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address
but not a mom, never a mom
But not as much as I love America
But not for tonight
But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better
But, not too much
But now
But now, forget about it
But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way
But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and
But, now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime
But now you mention it, there was ice there that night
but obviously someone forgot
But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose
' But of course this went in one ear and out
But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys
But, okay
But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it
But one of them has a very masculine energy
But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe
But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and
But Phoebe…
But Phoebe, wait
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year
But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other
But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming
But Ross, I’m such having a great time
But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out
But sadly I could not be enticed
But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did
But see, it was a plan
But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you
But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like
But see they don't know that we know that they know
But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here
But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton
But she didn’t agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey
But she just came up here
" But she knows Capricorn One
But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight
But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal
But somehow you came off as the bad guy
But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat
But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves
" But that also says, (In a sexy voice) "Come here to me
But that doesn’t explain why they keep taking my scissors
But that doesn’t mean you have to talk about it
But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state
But that reminds me, (handing back a clipboard) sign this
But that's all right, here's the number you can call
But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend
But that's okay, no problem
But that's only because you're not eating anything, right
But that's over
But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message
But that's what
But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more
But that was a hell of a kiss
-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you
But that would've been so cool
But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while
But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here
" But the guy is thinking, "Finally
But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower
But the minute we start to lie to each other… (Pauses after she realizes what she's saying
But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was
But then everyone will know
But then I decided to take it to the next step
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place
’ but then I figured, he doesn’t care if he looks like you
But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time
But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call
But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous
But then realizes she didn't have to do that
But then, "Smelly Cat", I got 25 cents and a condom
But then something happened that made it, shoot right out
But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket
But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr
But then you left
But the power, that is still up for grabs
But there are no boles, she's smooth
But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets
But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her
But there's something you gotta know
' But there's this other guy
but the rest of us have a lot of work to do
But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself without any outside help whatsoever
But the store wouldn't take her back
But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he’ll be there
But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown
But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see
But, they’re across the hall
But they're not here yet
But they're not your friends anymore
But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists
But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business
But they still made fun of you
But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead
But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, (reading from the letter) “If you accept full responsibility
But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat
But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards
But this is something I’ve been waiting for my whole life
But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown
But this so was
But this time she's doing it with a French accent
But this way too soon, you’re only gonna scare her
But, (to Chandler) you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela
But today, it's like there's rock bottom, then 50 feet of crap, then me
But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy
But, (To Monica) you do it with me once
But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new
But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now
But, uh, I made her dinner
but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you
But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls
But uh, I’m staying at my parents’ house, we could go there
But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright
But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time
But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing
But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch
But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh
But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space
But, um
But, um, apparently, somebody overslept
But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister
But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear
But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate
But umm, I-I-I’ll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van
But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know…
But umm… Oh, would you do me a favor
But umm, one of who is over there
But umm, still I’m-I’m mad at you
But umm, well I-I was pretty tight with-with her and her daughter
But umm, y’know just remember that it’s still really early, okay so, if it says that I’m not pregnant, that doesn’t mean that I’m not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don’t go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this
But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy
But, um, zoo dollars
But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street
But wait, there's more
But wait, wait, wait
But we broke up
But we can go, right
But we can prep the guy
But, we can’t go now
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night
But we had our best friend's interest at heart
But we haven't seen each other since then
But, we have to change first
But, we’ll stay here with you
But, we pick again
But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar
But we’re fine
But we're not gonna feel guilty about it
But we're not ready to tell yet
But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday
But we’ve only had one job
But what
But what about how much taller he is than me
But, what about Pete
But what about Phoebe
But what about you
But what does that gonna do
But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know
But, what if we’re watching a movie in here
But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend
But, what you and I have is so much better
but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs
But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist
But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's
But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH…MY…GOD
But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone
But when I see you hanging about with anyone, it's not unusual to see me cry
But, when we’re back home, we don’t do it
But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him
But who cares
But why
But why is Bill huggin' Pete
But with Mindy, now I'm happy
But would you like to have coffee
But, ya know, he's moved on
But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die
But ya know what would be even sexier
But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready
But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily
But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool
But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about
But y'know, it doesn't count
But y'know, she choose to find me
But y’know umm, Rachel doesn’t rhyme with draddle
But y’know we were thinking about you, y’know we ordered the Joey Special
but y'know what
But y'know what
But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you
But, y'know what, maybe it's just all for the best
' But you
But you already told me everything
But, you are
But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions
But you can't help me develop my new universal language
But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross
But you could teach us
But you did it too
But, you got up
But you guys came so close
But you hate sticking your finger in your eye
But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair
But you know, I could always find another masseuse
But you know, I'll tell you something
But you know what
But you know what I'm gonna do
But you know what, I think they had pot in them
But you know what's cool though
But you know what, you know what the good news is
But you know who takes out wind
But, you left the chair area
But you live here
But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die
But you'll never make it stick and you know it
But you might wanna tone it down a little
But your chin here
But your divorce isn't even final yet
But, you’re gonna have to tell them
But you're not
But you said one
But, you see, it's just
But you tell it really well, sweetie
But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground
But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I
But you've only slept with two people
But you wanted lumps, Ross
But you will always be the guy who peed on me
but you would not be successful
But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy
But you-you said black
But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this
But you-you-you came to see Lilly

'cause
'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out
'Cause Carol's a lesbian
'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project
'Cause her name's Lily
Cause he's dead
'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening
'Cause he was just so darn cute
Cause I already invited her
‘Cause I am really happy about us
'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment
Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff
'Cause I do
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship
‘Cause I don’t think you have to wear it unless you are
'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour
'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there
'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone
‘Cause I got another critic to go yell at
Cause I have a straight
'Cause I-I got nothing
'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right
'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers
'Cause I like that
'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy
'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man
'Cause in my cell, I can smoke
'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to -- (he stops talking suddenly)
‘Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute
'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this
'Cause I think that borders on child abuse
'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way
‘Cause it just sorta happened, y’know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch…
Cause I told him I was 22
'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla
'Cause it's a television show
'Cause it's-it's not his last name
'Cause, it's, it's really old
'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins
'Cause it's mean
‘Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky
‘Cause I uh, need to trade
‘Cause I’ve got a product report to read, it’s like eight pages, I hope I don’t fall asleep
'Cause I've heard
'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this
'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting
'Cause I was sitting there
'Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute
‘Cause look at them, and I made that, so… I know it’s gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it’s gonna feel like a million times better, right
'Cause mine get me out of tickets
'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox
'Cause of all the boxes
'Cause of all the riboflavin
'Cause of the restraining order
Cause once those cards are dealt
'Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league
'Cause otherwise you'd go for it
'Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, Drew Barrymore
'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad
Cause she uh, she steals stuff
'Cause that why he could trade it for protection
'Cause that would give him the control
'cause the
'Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around
'Cause the left one is lucky
'Cause there's time to make up for that
'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl
‘Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them
'Cause this place is kinda depressing
'Cause uh, this is today's Post (produces one from the other chair) and uh, these are the listings I found
'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez
'Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated
'Cause we're moving in together
‘Cause we’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on
'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like
'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy
'Cause where else would we get any
'Cause y'know it's been a lot of fun, for me
'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y"
'Cause you already know how to do that
‘Cause you already told her you love her and she didn’t say it back, then she called you and told you that there’s another guy, so yeah, go to London that’ll scare her
'Cause you came to me first
‘Cause you can still catch her
'Cause, you know, (in that voice) if you don't look good, we don't look good
'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know
'Cause you know what, lady
'Cause you need that
'Cause you're still into Monica
'Cause you see that body bag right there
'Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we're like this-this couple that fights
'Cause you were acting like you didn't

He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened
(he and Ross take another brownie,)
He answers it to see a young woman holding a fishtank

He can press her up against that window as much as he wants
He can still catch her

He can’t see us
He carries a briefcase

(He clears his throat noisily)
(He closes his eyes and moves them around, kinda like he's been processed by the devil, or something
He closes the door and they start kissing
(he comes out from their apartment with a huge sandwich in his hand)
He comes to what he thinks is the right one and knocks on it
(He continues to smoke
He could be a Glen
He could hear me
He could never get a woman like that in a million years
He couldn't even tell me
He could row like a viking
(He counts where she is again
(he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, where am I talking to, here
He crumpled like a piece of paper
He cut off his ear
(He cuts himself a piece of cake
(He dances around the dinner table and exits)
(He dances over to her and kisses her
He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision
He'd get trampled
He did it
He did my first suit when I was 15
He didn't blink or anything
He didn't get the goggles
He didn't have any
He didn’t say anything about no strippers
He didn’t turn me down
He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up
He'd like to talk to you
He does
(He does a little mimic of her dance
(He does and she smells his left hand

(He does so, and finds a half-eaten box of cookies
(He does so and Phoebe hugs him
(He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me
He does that
(He doubles over in pain in front an old man in a wheel chair
(He drapes it around his shoulders
(He drops it in horror
(He drops it in Phoebe's coffee
(he drops the box on the floor) Oh, sorry
(He drops the cherry and it turns on
(He drops the shoes, takes the brush from her, and licks the tip

He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it
He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me
(He exits and leaves the door open
(He extends his hand hopefully
(He fails
He finally asked you out
He finally chooses the one his right and goes in
(he finishes)
(He fishes a card out of his pocket
(He flips the coin and they all watch it hit the table and stop
(he folds) So
He forgot to leave his grip size
He found me
(He frees himself and resumes the chase) Kathy
He gave me a pill for it
(He gazes out of the window
(He gently tosses the ball to Chandler who catches it
(he gets a huge round of applause from his students
(he gets in the unit and closes the door) See
he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and
He gets out of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple of cabs
(He gets some more on the brush)
(he gets up and goes into the kitchen)
(He gets up and goes to find her
He gets up and puts on a nametag that says Ross, but doesn't quite like it
(He gets up and starts for the door
(he gets up and takes the cushions with him, as he starts to leave)
(He gets up to empty out his pockets) Okay
(He gets up to return the page, Carol starts to take the last of the food into the kitchen, but Ross grabs the last piece
[He gets up to shake her hand, but she ignores him
(He gives Gunther his shirt and Gunther leaves
(he gives her a peck on the cheek)
(He gives her his right hand and she smells it as well
(He glares at Chandler
(He glares at her
(he glares at him for a while) Yes
(He goes around his desk to where she is sitting
(He goes back into the apartment)
(He goes back to the couch and rejoins Monica, Joey, and Phoebe
(He goes in)
(He goes into a song and dance number
(He goes into his apartment
(He goes into the bathroom
(He goes into the bathroom, screams, and runs back out
(He goes into the map again
He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt
(He goes out the door
(He goes over and hugs her
(He goes over and kisses Phoebe, who is also stunned
He goes over and opens it
(He goes over and opens the door to Carol, Susan, and Ben
(He goes over and presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing the TV
(He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to reveal a fully furnished apartment
(He goes over to her
(He goes over to his table and they shake hands
(He goes over to Phoebe and gives her a kiss
(He goes over to pick up a stack of magazines next to her, and to get her attention, he throws them back down
(He goes to get the glasses
(He goes to her room
(He goes to kiss her again, but she turns away
(He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his head and says
(He goes to put his hands in his pockets
(He goes to put his hands on Monica’s shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back
(He goes to take it out)
(He goes to take the call
(He goes to the door and opens it
He goes up to her
He got phased out
He got so sad
He got to do it at your first wedding
He got to spend the whole day with you
He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea
(He grabs a deck of cards and pulls up a chair
(He grabs her arm to get her attention
(He grabs him and starts to drag Joey into Monica's room
(He grabs his carryon and starts rummaging through it
(He grabs his gun and shoots the bird
(He grabs his side and doubles over in pain
(He grabs it
(He grabs some towels and takes them to him
(He grabs their bags and sprints out
(He grabs the magazine away from her
(He grabs the pad and starts reading it
(He grabs the remote and turns on the TV to the chase

(He takes a picture of a less than enthused Chandler and starts towards the girls’ apartment
(He takes her hand
(He takes his finger and moves it towards his eye

(He thinks about it) Of course I am

He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything
He told me in person
He told on us
He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out
He took my essence
(He took out that thing they use to look at people's retinas and looked at Rachel's when she was shaking his hand causing her to flinch and scream at him

(He turns it over and reads the answer) Ask again later
(He turns to go into his bedroom then stops
(He turns to Ross and Ross makes a ‘Be strong’ sound

He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible
He wants to talk to you again
He was a big guy
He was fine
He was having sex with Amy Welch
He was here just a moment ago
He was just drooling all over you
He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something
He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-
He was more embarrassed about that than anyone
He was Paolo's cat
He was right
He was supposed to type "little", the idiot
He was unbelievable

He was you're health teacher
He watches Jeopardy
(He waves his hand in front of the woman next to him and you can now see his arm on TV
(He waves it in front of Rachel's face

(He winks and smiles
(He winks at Carol

I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob
I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a…keeper
I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother
I always forget that part
I always have
I always knew I was havin’ a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me
I always knew she liked him
I always made excuses about it, like
I am
I am 26
I am a good kisser
I am, aren’t I
I am carrying a very heavy couch
I am definitely gonna watch that
I am famished
I am finally thinking clearly
I am furious with him

I'd be cold, but I'm always cold
I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get—oh I see

I didn’t finish the whole letter
I didn't get a cat
I didn't get it

I didn't say anything
I didn’t say I wasn’t free
I didn't see that coming
I didn’t see that coming
I didn't see you there
', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money
I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do
I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok
I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling
I didn't think I was
I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket
I didn’t think you were gay
I didn't touch a guitar
I didn't wanna leave him alone
I didn’t want to be that guy
I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed
I did pay for half of it
I did that too
I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing
I did the windows, I did the floors
Idiot
I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it
I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment
I d'know
I'd let him check out my kitchen floors
I'd like that
I'd like that back too
I'd like to propose a toast
I'd like to return this couch
I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever loved
I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me
I’d like to toast, Ross and Emily
I'd love it
I'd love it too
I'd love some juice
I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch
I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone
I’d need an expense account
I do
I do have a newfound respect for life

I don't believe this
I don't care
I don’t care
I don't care how much he begs
I don't care how much you want it
I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk
I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat
I don’t care if those dishes sit in the sink until they’re all covered with—I’ll do them when I get home
I don’t care, I’m not going anywhere
I don't care, Rach
I don’t care, this is our apartment
I don't care what you think

I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese
I don't even wanna see Richard again
I don’t ever want to see you again
I don't ever want to suck your wind again
I don't feel guilty for her failures
I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight
I don't feel like talkin
I don't get it
I don’t get it
I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday
I don't get it, I mean, you just got him
I don’t get this
I don't gossip
I don't have a dream
I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages
I don't have a monkey
I don't have any issues with my Father
I don't have any more room left in the fridge
I don't have any past life memories
I don’t have anything
I don't have a plan
I don't have a pot
I don’t have a problem, you’re the one with the problem
I don't have a son named Jordie
I don't have her number, butt-munch
I don’t have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and
I don't have time for this
I don't have to give up the bag
I don't have too
I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them
I don’t, I don’t, I don’t have to think about it, in fact, I’ve decided, I’ve decided that, that it
, I don't, I don't know
I don't—I don't know
I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend
I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now
I don't, I don't think we've meet
I don't, I don't understand
I don't, I hate Joseph, ok
I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them
I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun
I don't know
I don’t know
I don't know about that
I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom
I don’t know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he’s a crush on
I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something
I don’t know, but
I don’t know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black
I don't know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing
I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug
I don't know, Chandler
I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around
I don't know, clean places
I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great
I don’t know exactly
I don't know, God, I
I don't know, he just started kissing me
I don’t know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas
I don’t know how museums work in England but, here, you’re not supposed to take stuff
I don’t know how to lead
I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me
I don’t know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there’s this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch
I don't know, I don't have my jammies
I don't know, I don't know
I don’t know, I don’t know
I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do
I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind
I don’t know if I could ever do that
I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know
I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal
I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am
I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day_
I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show
I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again
I don't know I guess I just got scared
I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember
I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night
I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and
I don't know, I lost it all ok
I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just
I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer
I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling
I don't know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I mean, I don't know
I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out
I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist
I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here
I don't know, I'm very tired
I don't know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system
I don’t know, it looks the same
I don’t know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out
I don't know, it's just…
I don't know, it's just, you know
I don’t know, it smells good
I don’t know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids
I don’t know, it would totally depend on her coloring and… (realizes) You got the job
I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know
I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out
I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed
I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's…
I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that
I don't know, maybe
I don't know, maybe I can't
I don't know, maybe we should keep looking
I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick
I don't know Monica
I don’t know one actor worth his salt that didn’t say at one time or another, "God, I stink
I don’t know R
I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old [Monica gives him a glare] -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings
I don't know, she's, uh
I don't know, some guy
I don't know, something girlie
I don’t know squat about dinosaurs
I don’t know sweetie
I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right
I don't know, uhh
I don't know uhh… (Pause as he thinks about it
I don't know, umm…
I don't know what else to say
I don’t know what I’m going to do
I don't know what I'm gonna do
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat
I don't know what I want to do
I don't know, what's a koondis with you
I don't know what she sees in
I don’t know what the big deal is
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented
I don't know what to do with that
I don't know what to say
I don’t know what to say
I don’t know what to say, I’m sorry
I don't know what we're gonna be doin'
I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you
I don't know where my wife is
I don't know where the phone is
I don’t know whether he’s testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control
I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or
I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette
I don't know who made you the boss
I don't know who she thinks she is
I don't know who this is harder on, me or him
I don’t know why
I don’t know why I do that
I don’t know, why not
I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break
I don't know, y'know
I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts
I don't know you guys
I don't know, you might be the first one
I don’t know, you’re here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was
I don't know, you tell me
I don’t like guys with boring jobs
I don't like looking foolish
I don’t like the name Ross
I don't like this question
I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad
I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom
I don't miss Marcel any more
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers
I don't need a roommate either, OK
I don't need flowers, I'm dead'
I don't need it anymore
I don't need luck
I don't need that today
I don't need this
I don't need this right now, OK
I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking
I don't need to think about it
I don't perform those kind of services
I don’t really know what happened with that either
I don't remember
I don't see any tater tots
I don't see it that way
I don't sound like that
I don’t speak English
I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress
I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again
I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about
I don't think he's the one who needs help
I don’t think I’d be comfortable with any of my old lovers there
I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day…
I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know
I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you
I don’t think Mom would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do
I don't think so
I don’t think so
I don't think that's going to be you
I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show
I don't think that's his name
I don't think that was my point
I don't think this is the best time
I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in
I don't think tho
I don't think we should go out anymore
I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright
I don't think you mean that
I don’t think you understand packing
I don't think you wanna go in there
I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of "Us
I don't understand
I don’t understand
I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend
I don't understand, why didn't you help that man
I don’t wanna
I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy
I don't wanna give up the bag
'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono
I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs
I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna seem too eager
I don't wanna speak, I don't wanna think
I don't want a beer
I don't want a cat
I don't want a ghost
I don't want it
I don't want Rachel to hate me
I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo
I don't want to
I don’t want to
I don't want to be single, okay
I don’t want to do that
I don't want to fly in the rain
I don’t want to hear about her
I don't want to know
I don’t want to look
I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy
I don’t want to lose you
I don't want to make it savory
I don’t want to move again
I don't want to see him get hurt
I don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair
I don’t want to talk about it
I don't want you on the trip
I don't want you putting any ideas in her head
I don't want you taking that thing
I don't want you thinking of me like that any more
I don't want you to see me naked
I don’t what your talking about
I doooo
I do Raquel
I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps
I do too
I doubt it
I drank fat
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect
I'd rather not
I'd really prefer a mountain bike
I’d really rather talk to him
I'd recommend you to a friend
'I drink tea
I drink tea
I dropped a cup
I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt
I’d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel
I dumped him
I dunno
I dunno, a little too Alan
I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny
I dunno, I loved high school
I dunno, it's weird
I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you
I dunno, there's just something about
I dunno, uh
I dunno what to say, Ross
I'd wait
I earned this
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me
I, Emily
I ended up at Ross's place
I, er
I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system
I even got another funeral for tomorrow--the dead-guy-from-today's best friend
I even made him laugh
I even signed up for helicopter classes
I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for
I exchanged the blouse you got me
If
I fall down an elevator shaft
If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that
If anyone asks, we’ll just say Ben addressed them
If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica
If anything I'm making you look better
If anything should happen to him…
If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do
If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones
I feel bad
I feel better
I feel blue
I feel good
I feel great
I feel- great, I fleel great
I feel horrible
I feel like I can't do stuff
I feel like Superman without my powers, you know
I feel really sad that we're not…really there anymore
I feel so
I feel so terrible
I feel stupid
I feel terrible, I really do
I feel violated
I fell asleep
I fell down an elevator shaft
I fell for you and I get clobbered
I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand
I felt it
I felt like Gulliver around that place
I felt like such an idiot
I felt really thick this morning
I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things
If he blows into one, does the other one get bigger
If he knew how you felt
If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place
If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person
If he wants a date
If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself
If I can’t-if I can’t give him up, then there’s no way I can give up a baby
If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it
If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon
If I don't input those numbers,
If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me
If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call
If I find that monkey, he's mine
If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something
If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is
I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think
I figured I'd just stay in your room
I figured out a way to make money
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even
I figured you taught him that
I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended
I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry
I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time
I figure my character has kids
If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too
If I hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would’ve put my fist through the wall
If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox
If I have to I'll, I'll do all again , I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, I'll go to the P
If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you
If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off
If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face
If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best
I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies
I finally get to run my own kitchen
I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it
I finally got my band
I finally won
I finished it
I finished my book
I first met Ross in this coffee house back home
If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda
If it does
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy
If it helps, I could slide over
If it is a new message, what is he calling to say
If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift
If it makes you feel better, I've attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America
If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else
If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do
-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl
If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle
If it's not you, this is a horrible story
If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or
If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now
If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best
If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest
if I would have sent the Little General in
If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is
If like the four of us could all y’know, hang out together
If only he were a woman
If only more people knew
I forgive ya
I forgot
I forgot I am totally against that now
I forgot my jacket
I forgot my paper
I forgot my purse
I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me
I forgot to turn off the bathroom light
I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing
I fought with (Pause) my colleagues y'know, the entire time
I found a dried up seashores
I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering
I found it
I found my identical hand twin
If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she’s gonna know you were in here
If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it
If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say
If she’s no fun, why do you want to date her at all
If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there
If so, give me a call
If someone I was still in love with was getting married…
If someone would just grab my wallet, it’s in my pocket
If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will
If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one
If that helps you
If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there
If that's, if that's really what you want, okay
If that's the problem, we've got no problem
If the car that backfired had run over you
If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct
If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family
If there was I wouldn't tell you
If these walls could talk, y’know what they’d say
If they can't find a home for her, they kill her
If they find him, they'll take him away from me
If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you
If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them
If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right
If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it
If this was a cartoon, you’d be looking like a ham right about now
If we broke up, and I lost you
If we can't get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard
If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night
If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down
If y'know what I mean
If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be
If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one
If you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you
If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you
If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free
If you could just…(Rachel grunts and throws her purse at it)…throw your purses at it
If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them
If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink
If you didn’t want to play, why did you come to the party
If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever
if you don’t get that
If you don't mind I'm gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt
If you don’t realize that, I can’t help you
If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor
If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath
If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner
If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh
If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party
If you go to a hotel you'll be
If you guys don't want it to be special, fine
If you guys ever have kids…
If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault
If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine
If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time
If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far
If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened
(If you know what I mean
If you know what I mean
If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together
If you lost it you lost it
If you must know the truth, I didn’t want to lose a perfectly good assistant
If you're afraid of bugs
If you're alive you answer your phone
If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can
If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard
If you’re going to do something wrong, (He grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right
If you’re going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars
If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you
If you’re gonna cry about it
If you’re gonna get all sensitive about it
If you’re gonna make me choose between you and the hat
If you're not going then I don't want to go either
If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still
If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I
If you’re planning on doing that throughout the entire flight
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right
If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up
If you say that one more time, I’m gonna break up with you
If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out
If you see this creep - call the cops
if you tell me, I might do it
If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong
If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it
If you've got enough life jackets
If you wanna call that a reason
If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call
If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try
If you wanna put a label on it
If you want
If you want a leash, go to the pet shop
If you wanted to punish them, you should’ve just made them hang out here
If you want, I'll do it
If you want it to be
If you want some privacy you can use my hole
If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life
If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it
if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it
if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do
If you want, you could just take a nap right here
If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really
If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now
If you win, we give up the birds
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere
I gather by that oh that he told you about me
I gave up, like, everything
I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies
I gave you a key for emergencies
I gave you my Snack Pack
I gave you one job
I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table
I get it
I get my bucket
I get the dollhouse
I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys
I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know
I get to have sex with the star of the play
I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours
I give people massages and stuff
(ignoring him and continuing her conversation) That's what I'm saying
(ignoring him) Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please
I go back there with lawn ornaments, he’s going to laugh in my face
I go, "Quack, quack
I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum

I-I-I gotta go
I-I, I have to tell you something
I, I-I-I believe I ate that
I-I-I-I can't
I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away
I-I-I just want you to know that I, the reason I didn’t look you up was, well I was afraid that you’d react, just well like, the way, the way you’re reacting right now, and can’t we just, y'know, start from here
I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand
I, I, I'm hideous
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that
I-I-I think you look great
I, I, I've never heard myself sing before
I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not
I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap
I, I just never think of money as an issue
I-I just wish you could tell me—just say, "I don't like your massages
I-I know
I, I know
I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big
I-I know that you're very upset right now
I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night
I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that
I-I like pizza
I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all
I-I'll call ya
I-I'll see you then
I-I love that guy
I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad
I-I love you
I-I'm a big fan of yours
I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan
I-I mean I don't know Howard

I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry
I-I'm Ross
I-I'm sorry
I-I’m sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one
I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast
I, I'm sorry, I uh [unchains the door and opens it all the way] I already have a roommate
I-I'm with the umm, the 57th

I insist on finishing this game
I, in turn, have noticed that you are not
I invested in this night-club and it’s opening tonight, would you like to come
I-I owe her this
I-I ran into you in the hallway in your building
I, I really do
I-I really do, I like you a lot
I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you
I-I really like 'em
I-I really miss you
I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr
I-I said you had a-
I-I saved you seat
I-I saw Barry today
I-I see you moved the green ottoman
I-I spent three years in Amsterdam
I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages
I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds
I-I still can't believe someone ate it
I-I sure will, take care
I-I think everybody’s pretending they don’t hear you
I-I think I know who the other guy is
I-I think I’m dying
I-I think I'm gonna look around a little bit more
I- I think they're great
I-I think we have too
I-I thought it looked better there
I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious
I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing
I-I used to be just like you
I-I've been given the gift of time
I-I've, I don't live here anymore
I-I've never met anyone like her
I-I wanna be with her, (points to the stripper next to her) I like her
I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower
I-I want to experience every moment
I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand
I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years
I-I wasn't here
I-I wasn't in that
I-I was there, you're not that good an actress
I-I was wondering, my niece you see is in from London—well Shropshire really but y’know—well she’s about your age I say
I, I work for a medical researcher
I judged you
I just
I just achieved Phase Three
I just ah, wasn’t listening then, that’s all
I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go
I just asked that girl out
I just asked you
I just bet I’d need these
I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so
I just came from the park
I just came over to drop off…nothing
I just came up to say, "Hi
I just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty
I just can't believe this is happening
I just can't believe you're in here
I just can't find
I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone… (Joey in a childish attempt to not hear what Rachel is about to say, puts his fingers in his ears and starts to scream loudly
I just can't stand you being here all the time
I just can't stand your friends
I just carry it around
I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk
I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week
I just danced with a wonderfully large woman
I just did
I just did it so my Mom wouldn’t give me grief about me biting them
I just didn’t feel like getting up
I just didn't, I didn't get it right away
I just did what I thought you'd want
I just don't feel the thing
I just don't have that much cheffing experience
…I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag
I just don't love him
I just don't things are gonna work out
I just don't think breast milk is for adults
I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know
I just don't want anything to spoil that
I just don't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start
I just don't want to be a part of it
I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck
I just feel so, uhh
I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this
I just figured we hit a dog
I just figured, you know, size-wise
I just gave away the ending, didn't I
I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken
I just got a page
I just got fired
I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment
I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what

I just have to make a call
I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don't go, rrroof
I just heard
I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it
I just hope
I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here
I just—I
I just—I can’t believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you
I just—I can't believe this
I just, I can’t stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don’t wanna be the cause of that
I just, I don’t understand, I mean, how-how can she do this
I just—I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for
I just, I feel, I-I just
I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off
I just, I hate this so much
I just, I, I can't see him
I just, I-I-I-I don’t, I don’t know what to say
I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know
I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother
I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y’know
I just-I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person
I just- I just wanna be married again
I just- I just wanna be with him all the time
I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry
I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out
I just, I think he just really likes you
I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley
I just, I thought Joey was there
I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love
I just—I wanna be around her as much as I can
I just—I want you to be happy
I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this
I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff
I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this
I just, just do this
I just kissed her
I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you
I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there
I just know it would make me happy
I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain
I just meant hypothetically
I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more
I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat
I just met you, I don't know you from Adam
I just needed to tell you
I just need to be by myself for a while, you know
I just need to talk to my friend
I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross
I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park
I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo
I just pretend to be a doctor
I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off
I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together
I just remembered, I have to do something
I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order
I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her
I just saw Janice
I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside
I just say someone on the—that looks just like you on the subway
I just sharpened her this morning
I just spelled the wrong word
I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit
I just spoke to your dad, and you know what
I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you
I just think it's nice when we're all here together
I just think it's weird, you know
I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or
I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life
I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat
I just think that this is happening too soon
I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know
I just think you're nice
I just thought he was nice, y'know
I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero
I just thought I might
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did
I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit
I just thought we might be here for awhile
I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob
I just took your hat
I just touched him and he went over
I just uh, came by to pick up my mail
I just wanna be alone right now
I just wanna call everyone I know
I just wanna check something
I just wanna clarify this
"I just wanna go back to my cell
I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body
I just wanna make sure it fits
I just wanna read something
I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma
I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh
I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best
I just wanna-(sees Monica)-Ahhh
I just wanna thank you for being there for me today
I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else
I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy
I just wanted to see how it's going
I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party
I just want him to love you like I do
I just want it the way it was
I just want this to be (Kicks off his left shoe) about what it is
I just wan't to
I just want to get over him
I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends
I just want to humiliate him
I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man
I just want to watch a little television
I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and
I just want you to remember this feeling
I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now
I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed
I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me
I just went for it
I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers
I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are
I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked
I just wish there was something we could do
I just work here
I just- you decide
I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast
I kept myself busy
I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out
I killed another one
I killed him
I kinda feel like it's my fault
I kinda got plans
I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of
I kinda had a dream, (pause) but I don't want to talk about it
I kinda have a dream
I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it
I kinda like that you worry about me
I kinda scared myself
I kind of lost him
I kissed Kathy
I knew
I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it
I knew it
I KNEW IT
I knew it, wow
I knew that
I…knew…you could take care of yourself
I knew you'd understand
I knew you were going to do this
I knew you were not okay with that
I know
I know-
I KNOW
I know about you two
I know a great little place
I know a guy who's the 18th
I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me
I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so
I know, and I’ve only been playing for like an hour
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head
I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid
I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now
I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just… (goes into her bedroom
I know, but—come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds
I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know
I know, but it's my job, sweethart
I know but it’s so hard
I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think
I know, but, I was the best, you know
I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it’s snowballing, y’know
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it
I know, but you have to open it today
I know, he's just so, so
I know he's the love of your life
I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him
I know honey, I'm sorry
I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore
I know how you can get him, take off your bra
I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset
I know I am
I know, I can do more than cook
I know, I can do this
I know I do
I know if you were getting married I’d feel, kinda…
I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with
I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date
I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip
I know, I know
I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles
I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her
I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person
I know, I know, but you’re gonna have plenty of chances
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I'm sorry-
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot
I know, I know, it's, it's almost
I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on
I know, I know that wasn't about me
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents
I know I'm no John Bon Jovi, (Monica laughs) or someone who find attractive, I'm just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently
I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings
I know, I'm so excited
I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker
I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you
I know I really miss him
I know, I remember that
I know, isn't he great
I know isn’t it
I know, I still am one of these
I know it doesn't make much sense…
I know, it is
I know, it is isn't it
I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah
I know it is the best
I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't
I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um
I know, it's beautiful
I know, it's crazy
I know it's crazy, but it's true
I know it’s frightening, but, big picture
I know, it's great
I know it's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it
I know, it’s horrible isn’t it
I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it
I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone
I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better
I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is (Goes and picks up the sandwich) the greatest sandwich in the world
I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships
I know, it’s sick
I know, it’s such a huge, life-altering thing
I know, it's tough
I know, it was amazing
I know, it was the best I could get out of them
I know, I’ve been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don’t you think
I know I will
I know I would
I know, me neither
I know, me too
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving
I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross
I known Ross for a long time
I know queen is high
I know, really well
I know, so do I
I know that
I KNOW THAT
I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way
" I know that "listen
I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train of thought, temporarily) that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid
I know that much
I know that one
I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore
I know that switch does something, okay
I know that there’s no hole there, I just really liked that picture
I know that too
I know the code to his answering machine
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is
I know there was wine
I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head
I know, this is a great apartment
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing
I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting
I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow
I know, though
I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge
I know, uh, the air, the-the trees
I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other
I know, what about Rachel
I know what I am doing
I know what it did
I know what's going on here
I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy
I know what you all are thinking
I know what you could make
I know what you meant
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard
I know what your problem is
I know where Joey would be
I know where Minsk is
I know where your dog is
I know who it is you remind me of
I know, why not
I know, yeah
I know, yeah, sorry
I know you
I know you can’t stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I’d try and apologize over the phone
I know you did
I know you did, cookie
I know you didn’t, I was talking about Monica
I know you do
I know you do but you and I can never be together that way
I know, you must've won like a contest or something
I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't
I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’m-I’m, I’m gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler
I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you
I know you're right
I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him
I learned that living on the street
I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did
I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don’t think your son will think it’s yours and be horribly traumatised
I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk
I left my wallet here on purpose
I left some knickers under your pillow
I licked my arm, what
I lied
I like Ben
I liked being the best
I liked him
I like 'em
I like her
I like her a lot actually
I like her, you know
I like it
I like it, and Emily likes it, and that’s what counts
I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders
I like it in the stern
I like mail
I like that
I like them a lot
I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy
I like this lily
I like waking up with you too
I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place

I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love
I'm actually your half- brother
I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes
I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage
I made a man twice my size cry
I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room
I made a promise that-(they cut to the other camera and Ross notices something coming out of Rachel's nose)-Oh hey
I made a snap judgement
I made fun of his accent
I made this game what it is
I'm a duplex
I’m afraid I have to agree with you friend Pheebs
I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask you to step aside, Miss
I'm afraid I might just be
I’m afraid, I’m not at liberty to divulge that information
I'm afraid so
I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected

I'm disgusting
I'm divorced
I’m divorced, and I have a kid

I'm doing just fine
I'm doin' good, baby
I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus
I'm doing this because I'm sorry
I'm done
I'm done now
I'm done with men
I'm Dr
I'm drowning
I'm Dutch
I mean
I mean,
I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies
I mean after all, we all are using it
I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya
I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it
I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment
I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right
I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes
I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO
I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you
I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants
I mean, and you know how people can be wrong
I mean, anthropologically speaking-
I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce
I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you
I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something
I mean, because the thing is…
I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you
I mean, Ben
I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo
I mean bullets have left guns slower
I mean… But-but I assure you I will figure it out
I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine
I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet
I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922
I mean come on
I mean, come on
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car
I mean come on, it's been twelve years
I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you
I mean, Days of Our Lives
I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it
I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own
I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love
I mean, don't do that
I mean, don't get me wrong
I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already
I mean don't you trust her
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of
I mean, do you want me to stay
I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work
I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart
I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to
I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what
I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything
I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it’s-it’s so great
I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says
I mean, except in my own head
I mean, first it's my jewelry
I mean first, you hate me
I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy
I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts
I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy
I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going
I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half
I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute
I mean, have you seen you
I mean have you thought about it
I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you
I mean he dials phones
I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend
I mean he just started going out with her
I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you
I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away
I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time
I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat
I mean, he’s like Joe Rugby
I mean, he's nice, he's cute
I mean (he sprays Phoebe with crumbs)
I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person
I mean hey
I mean, hey, y’know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y’know
I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone
I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing
I mean how are we even gonna ask her
I mean how can I accept a restaurant from hi-
I mean, how clean can teeth get
I mean, how could I do that
I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries
I mean how could you do this
I mean how could you not tell me
I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink
I mean, how hard can it be
I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler
I mean, how, how did this happen
I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"
I mean, how perfect is that
I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision
I mean, I
I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him
I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want
I mean, I can't break up with him
I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her
I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues
I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me
I mean, I could do all this stuff
I mean I could live in this thing
I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows
I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator
I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him
I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot
I mean… I don’t know, it’s just, I guess I know it’s going to be over soon
I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it
I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them
I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry
I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing
I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30
I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair
I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not
I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast
I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater
I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all
I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love
I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change
I mean if they had lost, we would’ve made them get rid of the birds
I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this
I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler
I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage
I mean, I gave Barry up, right
I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there’s y'know, a new mom
I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding
I mean, I have, I have to stop it
I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me
I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one
I mean, I haven’t done that since I was four and I washed my dad’s Porsche with rocks
I mean I haven’t sterilised it since the guys moved out
I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it
I mean, I have to respect her decision
I mean, I-I did what I had to do
I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters
I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe
I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared
I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn’t quite there
I mean, I-I-I don't get it (tries to drink the rest of the jam out of the jar and gets it all over his face, on his chin, nose, etc
I mean I-I-I love her, y’know
I mean, I-I-I've got to give my marriage another chance
I mean I-I-I was great
I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts
I mean, I-I’ve known him a lot longer
I mean, I,I will cleeeean it
I mean I just can’t, you know that I’m not good at confrontation
I mean, I just go down there every other day and
I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help
I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents
I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys
I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but
I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh
I mean, I know what I’m talking about
I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y’know, I know where everything goes, it’s always nice
I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid
I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but…
I mean I like uh, pizza
I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye
I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy
I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more
I mean, I’m always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you
I mean, I'm a very bad person
I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in
I mean, I'm disgusting
I mean, I mean
I mean, I mean don't' you think
I mean, I mean why not
I mean I’m getting pretty good at it
I mean, I'm going to, so
I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment
I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy
I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you
I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks
I mean, I'm not like you
I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet
I mean I'm playing by the rules
I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it
I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty
I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas
I mean, (in an Irish accent) it'll be grrreat
I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now
I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler
I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader
I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures
I mean, is it really so terrible
I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it
I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic
I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar
I mean, is that ridiculous
I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross
I mean it
I mean I talked for hours
I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night
I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now
I mean I think it's great
I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious
I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking
I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain
I mean, I thought we were happy
I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident
I mean it is soon
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team
I mean, it just feels right, don’t you think
I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it
I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine
I mean it'll, it'll just kill him
I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready
I mean, it must've been terrible
I mean, it's all my fault
I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material
I mean it's a regular space
I mean, it's a total party zoo
I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommate's girlfriend -- which by the way, I think she knows
I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so
I mean it’s better than you just-just moving here, ‘cause it’s us together forever, and that’s-that’s what I want
I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents
I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK
I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica
I mean, it's great, but…
I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute
I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know
I mean it’s just, it’s just climbing
I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary
I mean it’s like me and your dad, that’s a totally separate thing
I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know
I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date
I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out
…I mean it's my fault
I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby
I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one
I mean it’s not like we don’t have anything in common
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering
I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me
I mean it’s only been two days since he broke up with Kathy
I mean it’s over… (She stops suddenly, when she sees that demolition has already started
I mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back
I mean, it's Ross
I mean, it’s Ross
I mean it's so unexpected
I mean, it's such a stupid argument
I mean, it’s true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, we’ve grown apart, so, um
I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us
I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another
I mean it was fun one time
I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together
I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn’t you start feeling silly
I mean, it was never like that
I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it
I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it
" I mean, it was sooo humiliating
I mean it would be different if it was way into the future –and-and-and we were getting married or something
I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here
I mean, I've never looked at you that way before
I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm
I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes
I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air
I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July
I mean I was nothing before you
I mean, I was sitting there
I mean, I will cleeeean it
I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men
I mean I would kill for this job
I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead
I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you
I mean just ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them
} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why
I mean, last night I got my ear pierced
I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough
I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot
I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment
I mean, let's say I do make it, alright
I mean, like, he's a grown up
I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know
I mean like the sweetest guy
I mean like, who was that
I mean, listen
I mean, look
I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't
I mean look at him, look at you, (Starts to whine like a baby and Joey just glares at him
I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills
I mean look how brutal this is
I mean, look, I left a note and everything
I mean, look-look today you escaped (Pause) (Not believing it) death, y'know
I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about
I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance
I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me
I mean maybe you didn’t hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua
I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing
I mean, mittens are nice
I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just
I mean my God
I mean my Mom never thought this would work out
I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know
I mean, name one famous person named Chandler
I mean, naturally, you know, I said no
I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies
I mean, noodle soup
I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child
I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples
I mean nothing bad can go down
I mean, no, you’re right
I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg
I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up
I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh
I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball
I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont
I mean our flame, whew, is on fire
I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer
I mean pregnant
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done
I mean, really
I mean really mean
I mean really, think about it
I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains
I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me
I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her
I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit
I mean, she lives there, I live here
I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out
I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business
I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage
I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you
I mean, she’s going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned
I mean, she-she’d have to uh, move here
I mean she's not gonna leave me
I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day
I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out
I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool
I mean soup
I mean, so you said my name
I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel
I meant Chandler
I meant er, (struggling to concentrate) young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor
I meant female nudity
I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean
I mean, that could be you and Emily
I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head
I mean, that guy with the toe thing
I mean that makes, that makes everything different
I mean that's allowed
I mean, that's a typical guy response
I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache
I mean, that's it
I mean that's like you using my toothbrush
I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime
I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound
I mean that’s two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here
I mean that's unbelievable
I mean, that’s what this is all about, right
I mean that switch is connected to something
I mean, that-that has got to mean something
I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play
I mean, that was just mean
I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you
I mean, that woman made you miserable
I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y’know, you think I’ll ever get there
I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away
I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one
I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex
I mean there's no way
I mean, there’s no way I can make myself taller now, y’know
I mean, there's really no easy way to say this
I mean there's so much we don't know about each other
I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream
I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif
I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing
I mean, they’re gonna be engaged for like what
I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd
I mean they’re trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would
I mean, things just sort of happen around you
I mean, think about it
I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'
I mean this guy abandoned you
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery
I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her
I mean this is amazing
I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity
I mean, this is just too big
I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay
I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair
I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more
I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing
I mean, this is so cool
I mean, this is twisted
I mean, this is unbelievable
I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like
I mean this poor woman
I mean this, this Casey should be takin' down my messages, ya know, or, or, Rachel and I should be together and, and we should get some kind of me, message service
I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us
I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare
I mean, this-this looks so great
I mean, this, this makes sense for us
I meant, me plus one
I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall
I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional
I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game
I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh
I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y’know, because-because it was you…
I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but
I mean, uh, who
I mean, umm
I mean underpants, mister, that's what I mean
I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself
I mean, was it Gina
I mean was that just me
I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that
I mean, way to go Ben
I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say
I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know
I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment
I mean, we ended up cuddling
I mean we had an agreement
I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad
I mean, we had fun
I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other
I mean we have such a good time together
I mean, we have to erase that
I mean, we know it’s a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so…
I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one
I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he’ll be there
I mean we never said this was exclusive
I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing
I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic
I mean, we're living in the moment
I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up
I mean, we still care about each other
I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her
I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful
I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever
I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it's weird
I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys
I mean, what about you
I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats
I mean, what am I gonna do without you
I mean what can we do
I mean, what- Chandler, look at that
I mean, what do you like, what don't you like
I mean, what else is it about
I mean, what if all we've got are
I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together
I mean what if this keeps happening
I mean, what if we're at her folks' place
I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us
I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it
I mean, what is that about
I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup
I mean, what's-what's the deal
I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are
I mean, what the hell is that thing
I mean, what the hell were you thinking
I mean, what was I hoping would happen
' I mean, what, were you just full of it
I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, (In a British accent
I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally
I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer
I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh…
I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced
I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know
I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather
I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie
I mean, who is Julie
I mean who needs a savings account
I mean, who’s-who’s to say
I mean, who would do that
I mean, why all the sudden are you so
I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future
I mean, why not
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip
I mean, why should I let them meet him
I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat
I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
I mean, women really like that
I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'
I mean, wouldn't you guys
I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip
I mean, would you… (He gestures and spills some of his coffee
I mean yeah, but only for three days
I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it
I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend
I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up
I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it (She grabs the rest of the pictures)…
I mean, y’know, I’m not really that comfortable dancing with a—(Treeger throws him) We-he
I mean y'know, I'm thinking
I mean, y'know, 's'Barry
I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing
I mean y'know, until you got cut off
I mean y'know, we haven't been going out that long
I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina
I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around
I mean, you and Ross
I mean, you can't tell me what to do
I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh
I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you
I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet
I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip
I mean you’d think he’d be worried about me not showing up at his club
I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off
I mean, you had a sketch
I mean you had just moved in
I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet
I mean, you hear such stories about New York
I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys
I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too
I mean, you know, we've never really talked
I mean, you know what that means
I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies
I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay
I mean, you listen to me
I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked
I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk
I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore
I mean you really kept Joey's underwear
I mean, you really thing this looks good
I mean, you're a sweeper
I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk
I mean, you're gonna have to try
I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again
I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly
I mean, you're married
I mean, you remember what it’s like to be eighteen years old
I mean, you're my
I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings
I mean you're right
I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note
I mean, you’re the one they’re gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex
I mean you’re-you’re beautiful and smart and sophisticated—a lot of this isn’t based on tonight
I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties
I mean you suck like you’ve never sucked before
I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer
I mean you totally cracked him
I mean, you two are-are my… I mean, I’m lucky to have just one good… (They all start getting emotional
I mean, you understand right
I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what
I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times
I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that
I mean, you won't even be here
I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down
I mean you, you, you, you must have lost like
I met Russ
I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was
I met this cute bridesmaid
I'm excited
I’m exhausted
I'm fairly neat

I'm fine, fine
I'm fine, I'm fine
I'm fine it's just that—(She drops the box and in a reflex action tries to catch it with her arm, the knife slips out and slowly flips through the air and comes point first down into Chandler's shoe
I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay
I'm fine, thanks

I stalk guys and keep their underpants
I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake
I stayed at Kate's, but ah, nothing happened
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick

Is that why you're on this trip, huh
Is that yes
Is that you
Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite
Is there
Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here
Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering
Is there any chance you didn't see that
Is there anything wrong with that
Is there anything you need
Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this
Is there a problem
Is there blood coming out of my ears
Is there, is there something on my dress
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser

Is this the one that I threw out last year
Is this the umm, the memorial
Is this the way you get girls to go out with you
Is this true
Is this what you had in mind
Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth
I still cannot believe you’re engaged
I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant
I still can’t believe they’re tearing it down
I still don’t get how you know when it’s false labour
I still don't get to see you
I still have your letter
Is Tony Randall dead
I suck
I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling
I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her
I support you 100%
I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault
I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but
I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do
I suppose I’ve either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh
I suppose mainly sexual
I suppose there’s not much chance you did heard that, and there’s the call waiting so, I should go
I sure did
I sure do
I sure know how to pick 'em, huh
I survived college with him
I sw
I swear, I promise
I swear, I swear—(noticing Kristin's absence) How long has she been in the bathroom
I swear, I won’t say another word tonight
I swear I won't scratch
I swear to god, Dad
I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we
I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience
I swear you said you had the keys
Is your boyfriend the boss of you
Is your finger caught in that chair
Is your tongue swelling up
it
I take credit for Paul
I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase
Italian-American guy
Italian guy comes homes with a date
Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning
I talked to him today
I talked to Janice
I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come
I talk in my sleep
I talk to you and it's nothin'
I talk to you and nothin'
It all adds up
Italy, I think
I taped oven mits to their hands
I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop
(It begins to ring
It bit
It bleats, in protest
It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch
It can with the pants
It certainly is a miracle
It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica
It coulda been me
It could be a guy
It could be better, but it’s gonna be okay, right
It could be like a big giant guy
It could happen
It could happen to anyone
It could take time to get a taxi
(It could've been General Sal
It could’ve been worse, he could’ve shot her
It creeps me out
It'd be even more exciting if we were going
It'd be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles
It depends on who asked
It did at first, but not anymore
It did enter my mind
It didn't
It didn’t
It didn't look this big in the office
It didn’t mean anything
It didn't mean anything to me
It didn’t remind you of…
It disappears back there behind that baseboard
It’d, it’d be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite
It does
It does in mine
It does not
It doesn't count
It doesn't even fit you anymore
It doesn't go with any of my stuff
It doesn’t happen to every guy
It doesn’t hurt that (tries to take a step) baaad
it doesn't make much of a difference
It doesn't matter
It doesn’t matter
It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head
It doesn't matter who knows what
It doesn't mean
It doesn't mean anything
It doesn't say that
It doesn't say that in the script
It doesn't scare me
It doesn’t seem desperate
It doesn't taste bad
It doesn't work, and without picking up the phone leans down to it
It does sound appealing
It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her
It'd take forever to pry this up
I tell people secrets
I tell ya a lot things
I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while
I tell ya, it’s a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder
I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy
I tell you, I've never seen him this happy
I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business
I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen
I tell you what, from now on I’m never getting out of this chair, ever
I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night
It feels funny just being here
It felt good to be out of the rain
It felt like a 'big guy' moment
It flushes it
It gives it a nice antiquey look
It got caught on my watch
It happened in London
It happened to me
It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life
It has been in my head all day long
It has the nail
It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building
I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper
I think Barry is seeing someone in the city
…I think he deserves a Nobel Prize
I think he's a brown-nosing suck up
I think he's across the hall
I think he's baaad news
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball
I think he's drowning
I think he's right
I think he's shy
I think he's stealing from me
I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson
I think his butt would be angry here
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch
I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once
I think I blacked out there for a minute
I think I can come up with something better than that
I think I can explain this
I think I do
I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out
I think I got a shot at it
I think I have an old band uniform from high school
I think I just moved on to Phase Four
I think I just need lunch
I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel
I think I know that girl
I think I left a donut up here
I think I like it better that way
I think I'll pass
I think I'm gonna be sick
I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while
I think I'm gonna take-off
I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover
I think I'm still in love with you
I think I need a drink
I think I saw Rachel out in the hall
I think I should stay, I think we should both know what’s going on
I think I strained my voice screaming in there
I think it has to do with my working late
I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better
I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope
I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable
I think it'll look good in our apartment
I think it makes you look really dangerous
I think it might be raining
I think it's about to attack the Enterprise
I think it's a great idea
I think it’s best that we just forget about it
I think it's going okay
I think it's great
I think it’s great
I think it's great you guys are doing this
I think it's insane
I think it's jaunty
I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don’t even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee—Oh no, have I said to much
I think it's nicer when people just get along
I think it's okay that we see other people
I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late
I think it's romantic
I think it's sexy
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen
I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch
I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital
I think it's winning
I think it went into me
I think it would be really good for you
I Think last night was great
I think maybe someone's lonely tonight
I think maybe, yeah
I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like
I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that
I think my uterus just skipped a beat
I think once you're dead, you're dead
I think on my shoulder
I think on some levels she already knows
I think Rachel's here
I think Saturday—(groans in pain again)
I think she means (Imitates) 'You dance a dance class'
I think she's a blast
I think she’s here
I think she's OK
I think she took it pretty well
I think she would like that
I think so
I think somebody has a crush on somebody
I think somebody needs another lap dance
I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey
I think somebody should have it
I think some things are better left unsaid
I think so too
I think, sub-consciously…
I think that bitch cracked my tooth
I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him
I think that is so great
I think that's a little weird, y'know
I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died
I think that's the challenge
I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers
I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process
I think the baby can totally hear everything
I think the baby kicked
I think the check in is that way
I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school
I think they get it
I think they're very nice
I think this can go somewhere
I think this could be the real thing
I think this could’ve be something really amazing, but y’know this is probably for the best
I think this is it
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple
I think this is so great
I think this will be fine
I think Ursula likes me
I think we all did
I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here
I think we are, I think we are so on the right track
I think we can just leave it at that
I think we’d better start again
I think we have an answer
I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident
I think we proved our point
I think we're calling off the wedding
I think we're here
I think we should
I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up
I think we should let them win the next game
I think we've seen enough
I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off
I think what you have to do is try not to
I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot
I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind
I think you'd remember that
I think you have to draw him out
I think you killed us
I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is
I think you'll find this room more to your liking
I think you’ll like it, it has two out of the three tenors
I think you may have a drinking problem
I think you played the Gunther card too soon
I think your Dad must've added wrong
I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- (Realises)
I think you're better than you think you are
I think you’re done
I think you're great
I think you're my favorite
I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey
I think you’re right
I think you're very funny
I think you should definitely go out with this guy
I think you should drink the fat
I think you should go back with Gary
I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it’d be really good
I think you should stay away from him
I think you smell great
I think you’ve got concussion
I think you've gotta face it
I think you’ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India
I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in
I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back
I thought by the time
I thought he cut off his ear ‘cause he sucked
I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear
I thought it'd be great
I thought I told you not to come
I thought I told you to get outta here
I thought it was $98
I thought it was a key lime pie
I thought it was Chandler
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket
I thought it was like Long Island
I thought it was… quite tasty
I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder
I thought it went very well
I thought I was just one of the guys
I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn’t even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up
I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this (puts on her chef hat) on my chef’s hat
I thought I was making him filet mignon
I thought I would, but the translation's no good
I thought last night was great
I thought my number was up
I thought of a thing
I thought people were just bragging
I thought she just had one
I thought that movie was so incredibly
I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy
I thought that was a good thing
I thought that was an alp
I thought that was going to be romantic as hell
I thought that was just a rumour
I thought that was just what we called each other
I thought there wasn't a ball
I thought they could
I thought they’d brighten up the place
I thought this was going to be something we could do together
I thought this was, you know
I thought, uh
I thought we had a deal
I thought we have moved on
I thought we said seven
I thought we shared time
I thought we’ve gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other
I thought we were savin’ that for the Pope
I thought we were the patch sisters
I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money
I thought you could use the help
I thought you’d be out partying with Gandel-worf
I thought you didn't smoke
I thought you guys got married in uh, January
I thought you had this all planned out
I thought you had to do inventory all day
I thought you just really, really liked your new couch
I thought you knew that
I thought you meant in life
I thought you might be cold
I thought you only met him once
I thought your time ran out
I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you
I thought you said you read it in high school
I thought you wanted to adopt your cat
I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game
I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff
I thought you were Chandler
I thought you were crazy about her
I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today
I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me
I thought you were taking Ross to the game
I threw her at his man nipples
It hurts
I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food
(I tired but the rest is unintelligible)
It is
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together
It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention
it is amouz-ing
It is Judy
It is me
It is nice to meet you
It is nothing like the Hobbit
It is not over
It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you
It isn't
it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking and dials the phone
It is off
It is okay, if I stay and watch
It is our first official date
It is raining out
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes
It is starting to get dark out there
It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate
It is true
It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size
It-it doesn’t
It-it is broken
It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool
It, it sounds gay
It-it's probably just temporary
It-it's stuck
It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy
It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror
It-it worked with you
It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this
It just doesn’t…feel like we’re breaking up
It just got interesting
It just keeps getting worse and worse
It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does
It just makes more sense as an ensemble
It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that…
It just seems so futile, you know
It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it
It kicked
It kicked once, it’ll kick again
It'll be fine
It'll be great for next weekend
It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties
It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it
It'll be on the house
It'll be years before I forget you
It'll kill him
It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out
It’ll mean so much to me
It'll never last, he's just a rebound roommate
It'll totally freak her out
It looked like an eight, alright
It looks great
It looks like a women's purse
It looks like her
It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal
It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down
It looks like Rachel’s gonna put on a skit
It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation
It looks really expensive
It made me nuts
It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish
It makes me ache, you know
It makes them like me
It means it's healing
It meant nothing
It must have cost you quite a few debloons
It never occured to anybody to bring another one
I told Emily to come
I told everybody about this
I told her
I told her "Hey
I told her I'd have to think about it
I told her I didn't want to get the part that way
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well
I told them to go easy on him
I told ya
I told you
I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right
I told you not to do that yet
I told you not to go down there
I told you there was going to be sub-titles
I told you we're Joanna's two assistants
I told you we wouldn't have to get up
I told you, you don't have to do that
it only has to happen once
It only takes us two minutes to get dressed
I took a shot
I took her everywhere
I took these when I had my golfing accident
I totally don’t know what you’re talking about
I totally fit
I totally forgive you
I totally get symbolism
It probably would've been the most constructive solution
it rattles
It really and truly does
It really creeps me out choosing other people’s sex clothes
It really creeps me out when you call it that
It really does
It really hit me last night
It really is the most lovely building you’ll ever see
It really says that
It really was
I tried
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer
I tried to stop, but I couldn't
I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you
I try to go four times a week, but I’ve missed the last 1200 times
it's
It's
It's 4
It's 42-21

It’s all right; it’s probably false labour
"It’s almost as good as being there
It's almost as if he knew
It's almost our anniversary
It's almost time to try peeing
It's a lovely apartment
It's already started
It's alright
It's alright, it's no big deal
It's always been you, Rach
It's always on the news
It's a man's bag

It's a million-dollar idea
It's a money thing, we don't have any

It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh

"It's a typical New York City apartment
It's a uh, regatta gala
It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet
It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it
It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride
It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work
It's a whole big boob story
It's a witness not a perp
It’s awkward
It's a Wonderful Life
It says D-13
It says here that the knife went right through your shoe
It says here that there’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums
it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta
It's bad
It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease
It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually, but now she's actually stealing you
It’s bad luck
It's beautiful
It’s been a long time since I had… (tries to do the math in his head, but can’t) 327 + 238 dollars
It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks
It’s been a really bad day, whore wise
It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word
It's been kinda a long day
It’s been like a half an hour
It’s been six months

It’s eating me alive
It's Eddie you freak, your roommate
It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did
It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened
It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish
It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item
It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough
It's Emily
It's Emily everyone

It's gonna be a problem, isn't it
It's gonna be ok
It's gonna be okay, right
It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie
it's gonna be really hard
It's gonna be so great
It’s gonna be so great
It's gonna be weird
It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad
It's gonna be worth it
It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it
It's good
It's good news
It's got a
It's got compartments for all your stuff
It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey
It's gotta be better than that book
It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz
It's gotta be the first one
It's great
It’s great
It's gross
It’s guava
It's gut-check time
It's gym class all over again

It's-it's-it's almost dead
It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence
It’s-it’s-it’s perfect
It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation
It's, it's just a phase
It's, it's Mark
It's-it's me
It's-it's one of my regulars and he's insisting that I do 'um
It's-it's really nice
It’s-it’s so pretty
It’s-it’s, they’re-they’re wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale’s, so… And obviously in uh, in-in this case, (She grabs a pen and paper) I am going to report back, "USA not ready

It's just
It's just a fur ball
It's just a game Mon
It’s just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out
It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed
It's just a rat
It's just 'cause I couldn't be there
It's just going to be so great
It’s just gonna be too hard
It’s just gonna have to stay in, that’s all, everything will be the same, it’ll just stay in
It's just her water breaking
It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about
It's just… I just… Kinda…
It’s just, I’m ahh, I’m kinda excited
It's just I miss her so much
It’s just impossible
It's just, it's, it's me
It’s just, it’s just steep
It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world

It's just—I want someone who
It's just Joey and Ross
It's just like Brad to have to have the last word
It's just like, I have no family left, ya know
It's just like pulling off a Band-aid
it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day
It's just my lens
It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen
It's just old and dingy, that's all
It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go
It’s just so frustrating
It's just so hard
It's just such a slap in the face, y'know
It's just such reckless spending
It's just that
It’s just that
It's just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here
It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here
It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby
It's just that…ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too
it's just that guy
It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do
It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph
It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday
It's just that it's costing about a hundred dollars a minute to be in here
It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet
It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is
It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever
It’s just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn’t like me
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly
It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret
(It's just there flashing through his shirt) Hey Gary, who am I
It's just this thing
It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex
It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left

It's like dating language
It's like day one, floss
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life
It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit
It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror
It’s like I’m right there with Joshua
It's like I'm sixteen all over again
It's like I'm working in the field
It’s like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner

It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and

It’s nice
It's nice, and, we're having fun
It's nice that he has someone
It's nice to have a boyfriend
It's nice to meet you
It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it
It's nine o'clock in the morning
It's no big deal
It’s no big deal
It's no big deal, I do it all the time
It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time
It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team
It's not
It’s not
It's not a baby
It's not a big deal
It's not a blue screen

It's not a problem
It's not a purse
It's not bad at all

It's not different at all, is it
It’s not even a name; it’s barely even a word
It's not even an issue
It's not even that
It's not for another six hours
It’s not funny
It's not funny, this is actually my job
' It's not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it'll understand what you're saying
It’s not gonna be exactly like last time
It's not gonna be Helen Geller
It's not gonna cost you anything
It's not gonna happen
It's not gonna happen to Ross
It’s not good-bye, I’m not leaving until you get on that plane
It's not here Pheebs, it's not here
It's nothing, it's just- Okay
It’s nothing, it’s just that now your Father owes me five dollars
It's nothing to freak out about
It's not in the apartment
It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y
It’s not just that she’s cute, okay
It’s not kicking me, it’s kicking one of the other babies
" It’s not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own
It’s not like he’s…Chandler
It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them
It’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me
It's not like we agreed to live together forever
It’s not like we don’t know how to party
It's not like we're exclusive
It’s not like we-we know each other or anything
It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing
It's not my first time
It’s not okay
It’s not over until someone says, "I do
It's not really a good story
(It’s not really a scarf, it’s just a bunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together
It's not Richard
It's not Rick
It's not right what Emily wants you to do
It’s not something to be proud of, okay
It's not that bad
It’s not that bad
It's not that big a deal
It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff
It's not that hard to learn
It's not that I'm a bad actor…
It's not that kind of anniversary
It's not that weird, is it
It’s not the pants
It's not true
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone
It's Not Unusual, y'know, "It's not unusual to be loved by anyone
It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out
It's not what you think, that was
It's not worth it
It's not your fault
It's not your fault I suck
It’s now or never
It's ok
It's OK
It's okay
It’s okay
It’s okay, ‘cause y'know what
It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could
It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life
It's okay, I really… I don't mind
It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here
It’s okay man, be strong
It's okay, Rachel knows
It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway
It's okay, these things happen
It's okay to laugh right
It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again
It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything
It's OK, it's fine
It's old, it's definitely old
It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie
It's on
It's on again
It's one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend
It's one of my gifts
It's one of those magician stovepipe hats
It’s only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time
It's only Chandler
It's on us, all right, so don't worry
It's open
It’s open
It sounds familiar
It sounds really cool
It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice
It's our treat
It's out there man
It's over
It’s over
It's Paul the Wine Guy
It's perfect
It’s perfect
It’s perfectly in keeping with a trip that I’ve already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F
It's Pete
It's petite
It's Phoebe
It’s Phoebe
It’s Phoebe again
It's possible
It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore
It’s pretty ugly
It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction
It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend
It's Rachel and Barry
It’s Rachel Green from Bloomingdale’s
It's raining
It's real life, okay
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know
It's really big but it's cursed
It's really just about the math
It's really nice to see you again
It's really not that big
It's really pretty
It's really red

It's Smelly Cat the video
It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages
It's so annoying
It's so beautiful
It’s so beautiful
It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it
It's so good, isn't it
It's so good that you had a good time in Greece
It's some of Richard's hair
It's so much bigger than the cubicle
It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know
It’s so nice to meet you
It’s so obvious
It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask
It's sooo good
It’s so romantic
It's so sad
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family
It’s so weird, I have never been fired from anything before
It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear, in fact I hardly expected to see so much
It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab
It's starting to snow
It's still a gift
It’s still a tiny bit on fire there
It's still going on
It's stuck
It's stuff like that, isn't it
It's such a beautiful morning
It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up
It's Sunday night, and he didn't call
It's supposed to be that small
It starts with Monica reading a newspaper to him
It's textbook
It's Thanksgiving
It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses
It's that bedroom there
It's that cop
It's that terrible
It's that whole sensitive thing
It's the basketball playoffs
It's the best part
It's the—Chandler
It’s the chick
It's the fishnet stockings
It’s the Gellers
It's the heat
It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright
It’s the Knicks
It's the latest thing
It's the Mattress King
It's the Miracle Wax
It's the most intense physical competition in the world, it's banned in 49 states
It's the next day
It's the off light
It's the one he's licking
It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head
It's the only possibility, Phoebe
It's the other five I'm worried about
It's the right thing to do
It’s the second one
It’s the theme from Good Will Humping
It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben
It's the way my mother sees me from heaven
It's the woman from the hospital admissions office
" It’s—they just want me to be the surrogate
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents
It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street
It's this new guy and he's really good
It’s this way
It's this woman from work
It's throwing and catching
It still works
It still wouldn’t be clean
It's time for
It's time for me to conquer the physical world
It's time for my date with Joey
It's time for the good ice cream now, right
Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt
It's time to see your thing
It's time to start pushing
It's time to take the pin out
It's time to try peeing
It's tiny
it's too hard
It's too late
It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound
It’s too nice
It's too scary
It's too soon to tell
It's top notch
It's tough
It's true
It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter
It's two gifts in one
It's two tickets to Vegas
It sucks
It's ugh
It's uh
It's, uh
It's uh, $12
It's uh, 27 dollars even
It's, uh, it's a song
It's, uh, it's Chandler
It's uh, it's fine
It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane
It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding
It's umm, it's good, just here watering the plants
It's um the other thing
It's urgent
It's us
It’s usually, "Surprise
It's us versus them
It's Valentine's Day
It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse
It's very interesting, Phoebe
It's very sweet
It's very thougtful
It’s very very important
It's very weird
It's watching Yasmine Bleeth run and is chirping
It's way to hot
It's wee
It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away
It's what grown-ups do
It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left
It's what's underneath her sweater that counts
It’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble
It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller
It's wonderful
It's work
It's worse than the thumb
It's worth it, if it will get you moving
It’s worth the pain
It's you
It’s you
It's your call
It's your hair
It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue
It's your old friend Harry Elefante
It's your pro list
It’s your responsibility now, okay
It's your thing, and-
It's your timer
It’s you that is backwards
It tastes good
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid
It turns into
It turns out that I’m not free tonight
It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her…
It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job
It uhh, it won't go back
It uh… It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed
It was
It was 5
It was a 50's theme restraunt
It was a big deal
it was actually really great
It was actually the…
it was a fifty cent limit
It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater
It was a long shot
It was amazing
It was an accident
It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose
It was an accident, I swear, all right
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes
It was a really beautiful service
It was a simple mistake
It was a stupid play anyway
It was bat day at Shea Stadium
It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head
It was breezy
It was Chandler's idea
It was comfortable, it was familiar
It was definitely Michelle
It was dreadful
It was either but or butter
It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like
It was fine, y’know
It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin
It was good, yeah
It was great
It was great meetin’ ya
It was her favorite book as a kid
It was him
It was his audition in the first place
It was incredible
It was in my room all night
It was, it was great
It was, it was her voice
It was, it was really nice
It was just a car backfire
It was just a dream
It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't
It was just four years of parties and dating and sex
it was just nice
It was just so awkward and bumpy
It was just so cool
It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop
It was like finding money
It was like months ago
…it was like the Algonquin kids table
It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man
It was like torture
It was like you were marking your territory
It was Max's stuff
It was Michelle
It was my credit card you were using
It was my first time
It was my first touchdown
It was my plan
It was my quarter
It was my racquet
It was nice
It was nice, nice
It was nice to meet you
It was nothin'
It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship
It wasn’t like that I
It wasn't so much a party as
It wasn't your whole toe
It was only seconds after Rachel pushed the call button was she there
It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in… (The duck quacks
It was pretty cool
It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before
it was really nice
It was really so thoughtful of you
It was really sweet
It was ridiculous
It was right after I slept with Joey
It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier
It was soo moving
It was soo not an accident
It was so wild
It was terrible
It was the best day
It was the first frost
It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard
It was this perfect evening
It was to be looked at, but never played with
It was totally flirting
It was unbelievable
It was very very good
It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow
It was, wasn't it
It was you, pal
It was your mother's idea
It went great
It went under the table
It will be fun
It will not be fine
It won't be long before your the boss
It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk
It won't come off
It won't hurt
it would be like starting on the fifteenth date
It would be like this giant karmic debt
It would be so cool to live across from you guys
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out
It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name
I, uh
I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right
I uh, don't really have a preference
I, uh, got you a little present
I, uhh
I uh, I can't decide this
I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens
I uh, I got it from the gift shop
I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think
I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you’re interested, just as a thank you for this week
I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's
I, uh, I'll go see

I was an idiot back then
I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me
I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today
I was awesome, ok
I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure
I was bluffing
I was buried in an avalanche
I was busy with the business
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you

I was, I was trying to save my sandwich
I was just
I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault
I was just being polite, but, alright
I was just curious
I was just flipping through the channels and bam
I was just going to get dressed
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group
I was just thinking
I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group
I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips
I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding
I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel
I was kinda using that machine
I was laughed out of twelve interviews today
I was laughing
I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky
I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window
I was looking for you before
I was not and oh God, shh
I was not flirting
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them
I wasn't around that much

I wasn't ready for it
I wasn’t sleeping
I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was

I was thinking Chinese food
I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andy McDowell's new haircut

I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those…
I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily
I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it
I was wondering, please, if-if it’s not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please
I was working all day
I was wrong
I watched
I watched Monica bang his head against that thing
I wear it all the time
I went
I went back to Riff’s
I went down there just like you said, y'know
I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband
I went, I went after Ross in stupid London
" I went out with the guy for two months—I didn't get to win once
I went really long
I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad
I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house

I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum
I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison
I wonder what he wants
I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket of porn…
I wonder where she is
I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her
I won't
I won't go back
I won't go back to that hell hole
I won't play anymore
I worked in a Dairy Queen, why
I work here
I work Monday nights
I would
I would be going out with all of you
I would be shopping
I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening
I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time
I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face
I would have to say no
I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket
I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can’t leave him
I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so…
I would like to donate $200

I would love too, but I can’t
I would make a good cowboy
I would much rather be Mr
I would never do anything like this ever again
I would never do that
I would never do that to you
I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out
I wouldn't feel right about it
I wouldn't have thought it would be but
I wouldn't of even hired me
I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys
I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops
I wouldn’t want to do anything to hurt your
I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal
I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell
I would wait and wait
I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh
I wrote it this morning in the shower
I wrote you a letter

Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything
Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry
Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked
Look, here's what we'll do
Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but
Look, he said he’s not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him
Look--Hey, enough is enough
Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work
Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry
Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting
Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did
Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business

Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian
Look, I
Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted
Look, I am a reasonable man
Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK
Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom
Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone
Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just
Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable
Look, I didn't lose my mind
Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep
Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money
Look, I don't have to answer your questions
Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person
Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay
Look, I don’t need to steal some stupid ring, all right
Look, I don’t see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I’m a woman
Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place
Look, I don't wanna hear this right now
Look, I don't wanna talk about it
Look I don’t want anything to upset Emily tonight
Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine
Look, If I don’t get to London
Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me
Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too
Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party
Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday
Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you
Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it
Look, I gotta go pick up Ben
Look, I-I can't put them back on
Look, I- I could go on pretending-
Look, I-I don’t have any brothers; I’ll never get to be a best man
Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it
Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you 'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you
Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take
Look, I-I’m never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away
Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade
Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk
Look, I just don’t want to leave it to the last minute
Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me
Look I just thought that
Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don’t have time
Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it’s just that now that they’re in me it’s like, it’s like I know them y’know, I mean-I mean, it’s just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away
Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK
Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong
Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture
Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me
Look, I know what you're going through
Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright
Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it
Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us
Look, I'm asking a favor here

Oh, I know how we can decide
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know, it’s-it’s so, it’s so totally like, "Whoa
Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys
Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones
Oh I know, my God, this is so—this rice is so—I am so good
Oh, I know you did
Oh, I’ll get it
Oh, I'll have an espresso
Oh, I’ll-I’ll come hug you
Oh, I loved the play
Oh, I love him
Oh, I love my life, I love my life
Oh, I love that but
Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now
Oh, I love them
Oh, I love you
Oh, I love you too
Oh I’m afraid that plane has already pulled away from the gate
Oh, I'm a senior
}) Oh, I mean, look at this mess
Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way
Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong
Oh, I’m glad
Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase
Oh, I'm going on the lamb
Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just… (She scowls at him
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass
Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys
Oh, I'm having a boy
Oh I’m, I’m making this too hard
Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry
Oh, I missed you kids
Oh, I missed you too
Oh, I miss you already
Oh, (Imitating Ross) "you do, do you"
Oh, I'm not falling for that one
Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options
Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his
Oh, I’m packing
Oh, I’m Phoebe Buffay
Oh, I'm Ronni
Oh, I’m Ross
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up
Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat
Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it
Oh, I'm so glad you're here
Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos
Oh, I'm sorry
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun
Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife
Oh, I'm sorry honey, I'm so, so, (nasally) haaaaa
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry
Oh, I'm sorry I spoiled you're evening
Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket
Oh, I'm sorry, look at me
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is
Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed
Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out
Oh, I'm sorry, this is Cailin
Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-
Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else
Oh, I'm so sorry
Oh, I’m so sorry
Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it
Oh, I’m sure
Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer
oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great
Oh, I'm threatened by you
Oh, I musta missed counted or something
Oh, I must’ve said that after you left
Oh, I never could do it
Oh, in that case—(hops up and down in joy)—Yay
Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on
Oh, I ordered mine first
Oh, I promise, what
Oh, I read that in high school
Oh, I really needed that
oh, I see
Oh, I see
Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point
Oh, is everything in the car
Oh, is he hungry already
Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it
Oh, isn't he
Oh, isn't it exciting, I mean it's like having a boyfriend for life
Oh, isn't Lori a doll
Oh, isn't that fun
Oh, I spilled some
Oh, is that who the monkey's named after
Oh, is the play over
Oh, is there a problem
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse
Oh, is this the bug lady
Oh, I still do
Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two
Oh, it all looks sooo good
Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out
Oh, it doesn’t matter
Oh, it ended very well
Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so
Oh, I think I have the cash
Oh, I think I saw some in here
Oh, I think I see the problem
Oh, I think so
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding
Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained
Oh I thought they were just watching me
Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it’s a party for Howard
Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn’t realise that had become anything, yet
Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know
Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs
Oh, it hurts
Oh, it is
Oh, it is sooo perfect
Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated
Oh, I totally agree
Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong
Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim (sp
Oh, it’s awkward
Oh, it’s ‘cause they’re gonna eat—that’s the problem
Oh, it's Dr
Oh, it's easy
Oh, it's good news
Oh it's great, it's a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer
Oh, it's, it's huge
Oh, it's-it's Marcel
Oh, it's just
Oh, it’s just an anti-theft device
Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today
Oh, it's like a skit
Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home
Oh, it's my new beeper
Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple
Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off
Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing
Oh, it's not so bad
Oh it's OK
Oh, it's okay
Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg
Oh, it's perfect
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives
Oh, it’s Ross’s bachelor party
Oh, it’s so beautiful
Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this
Oh, it's so pretty
Oh, it's the compulsively neat one by the window, okay
Oh it's uh, over there on the table
Oh it's umm, good
Oh, it's wonderful
Oh, it's your audition from this morning
Oh, it was amazing
Oh, it was awful
Oh it was great
Oh, it was great
Oh, it was horrible
Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know
Oh, it was, nah, well
Oh, it wasn't a big deal
Oh, it was so amazing
Oh, it would be you
Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little
Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at…bigger rocks
Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in
Oh, I wanna see
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember
Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich
Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it
Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that
Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily
Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game
Oh, I was unbelievable
Oh, I went to have pizza
Oh, I will
Oh, I wish
Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to
Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time
Oh, I would love some
Oh, I would love to have kids
Oh, I would never bet this apartment
Oh, Jack
Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up
Oh, Jason
Oh, jeez
Oh Joey
Oh, Joey
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey
Oh, Joey, look who it is
Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late
Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time
Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell
Oh, Judy
Oh, just ask him
Oh, just do it
Oh, just go
Oh, just had a baby
Oh, just hold on a second
Oh, just look at her
Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man
Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up
Oh, just this
Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party
Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one
Oh, just updating the phonebook
Oh, just, y'know
Oh, Kath, we should get going
Oh, Larry
Oh, (laughs) I wish
Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there
Oh, let me see
Oh, let's not tell this story
Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline
Oh, Liam
Oh, like I’d give up that job
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him
Oh, like that's a word
Oh, like, uh, five minutes
Oh, like you don't already have everything
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross
Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme
Oh, listen
Oh, listen you guys
Oh, little candy hearts
Oh, little party favours, check it out
Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit

Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle

Oh look, did, did you just see that
Oh, look, here's Barry
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again
Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut
Oh, look, he's waking up
Oh look, I can't believe this
Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don’t want to talk about it, that’s fine
Oh look, it's the woman we ordered
Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes
Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV

Oh, so you really wanted to learn
Oh, so you're divorced
Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh
Oh, so you're playing Adrienne, huh

Oh, we are both so stupid
Oh we can't, we already have plans

Oh we flipped for it
Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party
Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there
Oh, we just
Oh well
Oh, well
Oh, well, actually
Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross’s wedding
Oh, well, ah
Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate
Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, 'cause they've had that thing for over a week
Oh, well, don’t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus
Oh, well great
Oh, well he's yummy
Oh well, hey, Joey’s loveable too
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming
Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born
Oh, well, I’ll show you around
Oh well, I’m divorced
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then
Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be
Oh, well, it doesn’t have a name—oh, okay, Phoebeball
Oh, well I thought that ah
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked
Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air
Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy
Oh, well just probably the worst one since I've been alive
Oh well, lost again
Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin’ at him
Oh well, no I…
Oh, well no problem there
Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt
Oh, well of course, the humiliating
Oh, well okay
Oh well, okay, good luck
Oh well, okay, hey, y’know how when you’re umm, you’re walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, that’s nice
Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him
Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the
Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe
Oh well thank you
Oh, well, that’s great
Oh, well, that shouldn’t be so hard, now that you’re dating
Oh, well that's not so crazy
Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross
Oh well, that’s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him
Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here
Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up
Oh, well this is awkward
Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know
Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some
Oh, well um, not right now
Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I'd curl up in it
Oh, well we cut the trip short
Oh, well, we have to celebrate
Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister
Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know
Oh well y'know
Oh, well y'know, I would've called but I lost your phone number and then ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldn't find it
Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime
Oh well, you don’t want to do that now
Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see

Oh, we're having spaghetti
Oh, we're not doing that
Oh we're not out
Oh, we're not seeing a movie
Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred
Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game
Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed
Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum
Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better
Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear
Oh what
Oh, what
Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats
Oh, what a crappy night
Oh, what a great argument, exhaling

Ok, and this is Funny Clown

Okay
'Okay
{Okay
O-kay

Okay, all right, here we go
Okay, all right, how's this
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great
Okay, all right, I think you’re great, I think you’re sweet, and you’re smart, and I love you
Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches
Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not
Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky
Okay, all right, whew
Okay, alright, I have a question, then
Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even
Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell
Okay, and-and I promise that I’ll keep you safe and warm until you’re ready to have them take you home, so… Oh
Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness
Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition
Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um
Okay, and whenever I can't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me
Okay, anytime
Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control
Okay, a thousand
Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err

Okay, buddy-boy
Okay, but
Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back
Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils
Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day
Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me
Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing
Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about
Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed
Okay, but let's say there was
Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together
Okay, but now see you're crying
Okay, but only if you give me a drag
Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist
Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era
Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper
Okay, but there is a big difference
Okay, but there is a wire back there
Okay, but this can’t be good for the baby
Okay, but this is the last time
Okay, but try and get Joey too
Okay, but we can’t leave in the small apartment after we’ve lived here
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me
Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good

Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny
Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down
Okay, first we'll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn't work we can go back to

Okay, he sees us
Okay, hey, museum geeks, party’s over
Okay, hey, that's okay with me
Okay, hold my crawler
Okay, hold on
Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is
Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice
Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend
Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck
Okay, how do you feel now
Okay, how long is this going to go on
Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand (Holds up his left hand) twice
Okay, hug and roll time
Okay, I accept that
Okay, I admit it
Okay, I am going back in
Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather
Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs
Okay, I did not abandon Rachel
Okay, I didn’t hear that
Okay, I didn't know you would say that
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half
Okay, I do
Okay, I don't know how to talk to you
Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore
Okay, I don't sound like that
Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore
Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore
Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie
Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else
Okay, I freaked out a little
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it’s in my closet on the left-hand side
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there
Okay, I got it
Okay, I got one
Okay, I gotta get to get to work
Okay, I gotta go
Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice

Okay, I’m gonna play my sperm card one more time
Okay, I’m gonna put this (her suitcase) in the car
Okay, I’m gonna show you a picture of Ross
Okay, I’m hearing
Okay, I'm in love with her
Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer
Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything
Okay, I'm not getting this
Okay, I’m not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats
Okay, I’m not giving up the apartment
Okay, I'm not gonna have one
Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth
Okay, I'm not just waitressing
Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum
Okay, I'm the baby
{Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees
Okay, I'm working on my flirting
Okay, in case of emergency, call
Okay, I need a date
Okay, I need a, I need a drink
Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me
Okay, I promise, I’ll end it
Okay, I see what's going on here
Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat
Okay, is this the day of good news or what
okay, it fits
Okay, I think I get how to do this
Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you
Okay, it’ll take just a little while to prepare the embryos
Okay, it must just be me then
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment
Okay, it's coffee
Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things
Okay, it's in spasm
Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight
Okay, it's missing something
Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her
Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed
Okay, it’s not, it’s not
Okay, it’s not Relaxi Cab
Okay, it's okay
Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson
Okay, it's second down
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars
Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information
Okay, it was my idea, but I don’t feel good about it
Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest
Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore
Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did
Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever
Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking
Okay, I've broken them down into categories
Okay, I’ve got a carton of milk in my fridge I’ve had a longer relationship with
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too
Okay, I've got three of my five
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out
Okay, I… (Walks away
Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold
Okay, I was coming over here and this driver…

Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr
Okay Joey
Okay, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block
Okay, Julio the cat
Okay, just a little scared
Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy
Okay, just give me the damn drops
Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn’t show up by then, then just come on home
Okay, just sweep it
Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees
Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out
Okay, just wait, please
Okay, keep saying it
Okay, knock yourself out, Larry
Okay lady, you're out of here
Okay lady, your lurking days are over
Okay, last chance
Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes

Okay, listen, I really like you
Okay, London 1…
Okay, look at this one

Okay, look, I’m gonna have to ask you all to leave
Okay, look, Joey
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot
Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here
Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains
Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work
Okay, look, this could be a really long game
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know
Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes
Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience
Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food
Okay man

Okay, my turn

Okay, no problem
Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go
Okay, no, that's not the right decision
Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong
Okay, not without a kiss

Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I’ve got you, me, and Chandler and I’m gonna invite Gunther ‘cause, well, we’ve been talking about this pretty loud
Okay, now we just need something borrowed
Okay, now you're even cuter
Okay, now you're just kinda tidying
Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song
Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U
Okay, oh, here's what you do
Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder
Okay, okay
Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades
Okay, okay, but Rachel’s gonna be here too, can’t I just ask her this stuff
Okay, okay, bye
Okay, okay, come on, you can do it
Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please
Okay, okay, fine
Okay, okay, fine, fine
Okay, okay, fine, you’re right
Okay, okay, hey
Okay, okay, I checked
Okay, okay, I'll go first
Okay, okay, I'm sorry, it will never happen
Okay, okay, I tell you what
Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything
Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr
Okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, I got one
Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared
Okay, okay, okay, the black
Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here
Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home
Okay, okay, so we're in the car
Okay-okay that-that's amazing
Okay, okay, well then answer me this
Okay, okay, we're approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to their view of Ugly Naked Guy, so that we actually see him
Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right
Okay, okay, what's going on
Okay, okay, yes, it is
Okay, okay, you got it
Okay, one
Okay, one more, please
Okay, one question
Okay, one thing at a time
Okay, on three
Okay, ooh, alright
Okay—ooh, but are you going to have time to read it
Okay, ooh, let’s plan the wedding reception
Okay, ooh (starts dialing)
Okay, Pheebs
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change
Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little… Y'know, it didn't have any… It-it, well it blew
Okay, Pheebs, y’know what, let’s look at this objectively all right
Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what
Okay, Phoebe you know what you're doing right
Okay, pick a card
Okay, pick a card, any card
Okay, quick and painful
Okay Rach, before anything happens (He takes off his coat) I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules
Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back
Okay, Rachel, get me perfume
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles
Okay, ready
Okay, reasons for abandonment, A
Okay, relax, relax
Okay, retract the device, retract the device
Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that
Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here
Okay, Ross is in the bathroom
Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything
Okay, scarf’s done
Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still…
Okay, see
Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans
Okay, see that blind guy right there
Okay, see ya
Okay, see ya later
Okay, she is the star of the play
Okay, she would love that
Okay-shhh, I have to finish
Okay, shoot
Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right
Okay, sit down
Okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little… Oh no—wait no, no
Okay, so…
Okay so, by melting, you meant melting
Okay, so did you find any apartments
Okay, so he's out of here
Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him
Okay, so how do we decide that
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it
Okay, so I guess that's about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in
Okay, so I’m done my part, okay
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops
Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas
Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised
Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey
Okay, so it's a date
Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then
Okay so Jason is sensitive, (holds up one finger) but now so's Vince (holds up one finger on her other hand) Plus, Vince has the body y'know
Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming
Okay, so let me just get this straight
Okay, so let’s play for some pepper
Okay, somebody call it this time
Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend
Okay, some tricks of the trade
Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows
Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates
Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct
Okay, so Richard, Richard
Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route
Okay, so this time I won't quit
Okay, so to you, death is fashion
Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast
Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first
Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview
Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on
Okay, so we're cool
Okay, so, we're in the car…
Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing
Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler
Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off
Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice
Okay, so when do you want to go
Okay, so you both just know this stuff
Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time
Okay, stalk me for a while
Okay, (starts to pack up her stuff) fine
Okay, stop
okay, sure
Okay, sure
Okay, swear you won’t tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna’s office
Okay, (takes out a notepad) Las Vegas 1, London 0
Okay, tell me your happy place
Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag
Okay, thanks
Okay, thank you, Mr
Okay, that actually makes more sense
Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same high school
Okay, that is all you
Okay that is the one we already have
Okay that’s even sadder
Okay, that's great
Okay, that's great, but can we make it smaller
Okay, that's like the least fun game ever
Okay, that's, that's enough
Okay, that’s-that’s not funny
Okay, that we may be able to do
Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and It’s All Relative
Okay, the last thing…
Okay then
Okay, then get the lobster
Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months
Okay, then maybe I can come too
Okay, then what happened
Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight
Okay, then y'know what
Okay, then you don’t know what it feels like when one of them comes back
Okay, the old hug and roll
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes
Okay, the owner of Allesandro’s came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef
Okay, there are no famous Joey’s
Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God
Okay, there was some staring and pointing
Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap
Okay, they are
Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me
Okay, they have had a very difficult year
Okay, they’re gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives
Okay, they're just talking
Okay, they're mean
Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers
Okay, this is empty
Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought
Okay, this is good, this is good
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there
Okay, this isn't working
Okay, this is the den
Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this
Okay, this one I like
Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff
Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me
Okay, throw it straight this time
Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups
Okay, time to take off the bra
Okay, (to Chandler) this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right
Okay, (To Monica) hope I see you tomorrow night
Okay, two larges coming right up
Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler
Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint
Okay, uhh, I think I'm going to run to the ladies room
Okay uh, however…
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry
Okay, uh Pheebs, quick
Okay, uh well, let's try one
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout
Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell
Okay, umm
Okay, umm, her name is Carol
Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica
Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England
Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage
Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A
Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah
Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow
Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person
Okay, umm, you're a loon
Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial
Okay, um, stay
Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it
Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes—Unless she wants me to be looking at that
Okay, wait
Okay, wait a minute
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
Okay, wait, you gotta hang up 'cause we're gonna be late
Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it
Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away
Okay, we have like ten minutes
Okay, we have our stripper
Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know… And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject
Okay, well
Okay, we'll be here
Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross
Okay, we’ll give a call if anything comes up
Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line
Okay well, he would turn things to gold
Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something
Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know (in a high pitched voice) Wow
Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes
Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and

Okay, we'll start with the building
Okay, well then how about a handshake
Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom

Ok, there is no top
Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it

So I asked myself, "Who are my friends
So I can be by myself
So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife
So, I can’t wait to see this place you’re getting married
So, I decided I’m definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler
So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others
So I did tell you
So… I'd invite you, but umm, I only have two tickets left
So I don't think I should do it anymore
So, I don’t think we can see each other anymore
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success
so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel
So, I figured it out
So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y=know
So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff
So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down
So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party
So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay
So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR
So if you don’t give me that number then I’m going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken
So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things
So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK

So I’m sorry, no party
So I’m still torn
So I’m thinking about asking Rachel out tonight
So I'm thinking about you
So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it
So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me
So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy
So in the words of A
So in your whole life, you've only been with one—(He gets a look too)—oh
So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them

So, I think you all know what I mean
So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so
So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay
So I thought ‘til I’m not, I’m just gonna play all my songs on this drum
So it'll be either you two (Points to Joey and Raymond) or you two
So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh
So it looks like you’ve got some great experience here
So I told Carl, 'Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur
So, it's a typical day at work
So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree
So, it's great to see ya

Stop saying that
Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented

that
That
That actually, uh, that sounds interesting
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place
That, and this
(That annoying competitiveness thing kicks in again, what the heck is that with her and why must the writers show it every flippin' episode
That aspirin dance really works
That audition
That bag is gonna get you that part
That blue freckle
That body
That, but-but nicer
That can't be good
That can't be smart
That can't be the one Rachel's talking about
That chick can't handle my corner
That cold makes you sound so great
That commercial always makes me so sad
That could be a four or a five
That could be it
That counts
That cup is mine
That cute nibbly noise when she eats
That'd be good
That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is
That didn't happen, I made that up
That didn't work out
That dies with me
That does
That does make sense
That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch
That does not sound stupid to me
That doesn’t make me sound too good does it
That doesn't matter
That doesn't mean anything
That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape
That doesn’t mean that-that you're in love with me
That doesn't seem fair
That doesn’t sound like thinking to me
That dress
That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that’s your department now
That game should not be played without my supervision
That guy, he burns me up
That guy is so rude
That guy Lipson
That guy's peeing
That had to hurt
That he doesn't exist
That helps a lot
That horrible woman just took my machine
That hurt [flicks Monica]
that I
That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her
That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first
That info-mercial
That I ran into Richard
That is
That is a boy’s apartment, it’s dirty and it smells
That is a dot
That is a great idea
That is all
That is amazing
That is an excellent excellent question
That is Aunt Iris
That is a wonder
That is correct
That is excellent
That is funny
That is good news, Ross
That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her
That is how God intended it
That is IT
That is never good
That is no place for a woman
That, is not a cat
That is not a happy hi
That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing
That is not true
That is, one big drink
That is one fun game
That is one good looking man
That is our friend
That is painfully funny
That is quite a situation
That is really nice…lying
That is so cool
That is so cruel
That is so funny
That is so good
That is so great
That is so made up
That is so not
That is so not my motto
That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear
That is so not true
That is sooo not true
That is soo sweet
That is so sad
That is so sweet
That is so sweet, you guys
That is so terrible
That is so unfair
That is so weird
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse
That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen
That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time
That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world
That is the most ridiculous
That is the new plan
That is the sweetest thing, I just
That is the unusual activity
That is unfair
That is Ursa Major
That is very dad
That is what the thing is
That is wild
That is your only job
That I was not expecting
that juggling thing is amazing
That just cost me four bucks
That just means it's working
That kinda sounds like your dream dude
That little naked guy would be me
That'll be $2,000
That'll be $4
That'll teach you to lick my muffin
That'll turn back time
That'll work
That'll work too
That makes more sense
That makes sense
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon
That means he's artistic
That means that’s it’s like 75 percent chance of no baby at all
That might work
That must be our alcohol and beers
That must be why I got fired last week
That must've felt so great
That my friends is my New Year's resolution
That new mountain bike
That night we, uh- we had-
That noise you just made
That, no, it's perfect
That—okay, that’s a lot of pressure on me and my uterus
That old jackass
That one doesn't look very fulfilled
That one's definitely Ben
That one will
That only took me an hour
That opens my cervix
That oughta do it
That oughta get her talking to me again
That oughta sweeten it up, huh
That Paolo thing was barely a relationship
That part was perfect for me
That really is something; that's really cool
That really means a lot
That ring
That ripped
That ripped real nice
That's
That's…
That’s…
That's $12
That's 56 to him
That's a baby
That's a bad duck
That's a bird
That's about 60 cents
That's actually on television
That's a defense
That's a dog, every house should have a dog
That's a four
That’s a good call
That's a good idea
That’s a good idea
That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'
That’s a good idea for a business
That's a good one
That's a good plan, Joe
That's a good point
That’s a good point
That's a good start
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him
That's a great idea
That's a great name
That’s ah, that’s pretty nice
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get
That's a little more than I wanted to see
That's all
That’s all
That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard
That's all I know
That's all I'm asking for
That's all it was
That's all right
That's all right, Rache, we got the bags
That’s all you’re basing this on
That's all you wrote
That's almost as much as a new book
That’s a lot of Monica
That’s a low one
That's alright, I'll take it
That’s also like the tenth time you told us
That's always fun to be
That’s a mailman
That's amazing
That same plane cabin, Ross is working on a crossword puzzle and Rachel is asleep against his shoulder
That sandwich really does smell good
That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life
That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza
That's a pig
That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities
That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your
That's a tomato
That's a two line part
That's a uh, that's a tough combination
That saves us a conversation
That's a whole lotta naked
That's because all people are selfish
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong
That's because I'm in front of them
That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs
That's because they are
That's been sitting out
That's Bill Clinton
That's bluffing
That’s called a scrum, okay
That’s Carol with your son
That’s ‘cause-‘cause you’re mom’s dog kept-kept looking at me
That's 'cause you have it
that's classic
That's clever
That's closer
That's cool
That’s correct
That's crap
That's crazy
That’s crazy
That's Daddy
That's different, okay
That's Dudley Moore
That's easy, baggage claim
That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina
That's easy for you to say, you found one already
That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed
That seems pretty cool
That—(sees that Joey is about to leave) where are you going
That's even worse
That's excellent
That's exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman
That’s Fergie baby
That's fine
That’s fine, actually I’m on the hiring committee, so there’ll be at least one friendly face
That's fine, I'll just wait
That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth
That's fine, thank you
That's fine, yeah
That's funny
That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel
That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm
That’s good
That's good enough
That's good, have a seat
That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh
That's good one too, Pheebs
That's good, that's good
That's good too
That's gotta suck, huh
That's great
That’s great
That's Great
That she left you
That she left you for another woman that likes women
That she likes women
That's 'help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air
That's hilarious
That's him
That's horrible
That's how much you wanted to be with someone
That's how radio stars escape stalkers
That's how she paid for all my dance—karate lessons
That shows integrity
That's how they do pants
That's impossible
That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city
That's interesting
that's it
That's it
That’s it
That's it, just hey
That's it push
That's it, thanks, good night
that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'
That's just a lot of big talk, y'know
That's just great
That’s just halftime, there’s more of this
That's just poking me in the eye
That’s just the way it is

That's so great
That’s so great
That’s so great for you guys

That's the dream
That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me
That's the only explanation for it

That's the same month as Halloween
That's the smallest body part you can major in
That's the spirit I'm looking for

That's too much
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION
That's tough
That's true
That’s true
That’s true, thanks dad

That's uh -- ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece
That's uh, that's my sister's boyfriend

That's very nice
That's very sweet
That's very thoughtful of you
That's way uptown
That's weird
That’s weird
That’s weird, she locked the door
That's what he does, y'know
That’s what I did
That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales
That's what I keep saying
That's what I'm
That's what I'm telling you
That's what I said
That's what it is, that's what I need
That's what I told her
That's what it says
That's what it sounded like
That’s what I wanted to name my kid
That’s what I want to talk to you about
That's what makes it so special
That's what my mom said
That's what's weird
That's what they'll call us
That's what this is about
that's what, two bottles
That’s what we did
That’s what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school
That's what we were off doing
That's what you heard
That’s what you really want
That's what you said last night
That's what you say at the end of a date
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours
That's what you want
That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'the munchies
That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'
That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again
That's where I went
" That's where that came from
That's who
That's why
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot
That's why I can't take this job
That's why I can't wear a digital watch
That's why I got up too
That's why I lost my toe
That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda
That’s why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking…
That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives
That's why I was getting married
That's why they call it the 'tray spot
That's why they trashed me
That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us
That’s why we got to find Monica
That's why we're always saying "Terry's a jerk
That's wild
That's wonderful
That's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different kind of chick
That's your call
That-that great huh
That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'
That, that is funny
That-that’ll just bring me down
That - that's an idea
That-that’s bad
That-that’s gotta be embarrassing
That-that's it, that's it, all right
That that's ridiculous
That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me
That, that's the third sign today
That, that's what's stupid
That-that’s why you’re here
That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head
That-that was like the worst breakup in history
That there’s nothing we can do
'That thing'
That thing is not coming in here
That thing, it's a uhh
That—this milk is mine
That tone will not make me go any faster
That uh…
That uh, barks into the night
That uh, hotel you stayed at called
That uh, that my sweatshirt

That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that

That wasn't about being picky
That wasn't a real date
That was one good minute
That was pretty intense huh
That was really good
That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now
That was really great
That was so awesome
That was so lame
That was some hot love you gave me

That was there when I got here
That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London
That was the water fountain
That was unbelievable
That was you
That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing
That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, 'Where's number 27
That way she knows you love her
That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing
That WENUS
That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know
That won't go with this dress though
That word was swans
That worked for a lot of girls in my high school
That would be Casey
That would be fine
That would be great
'That' would be Marcel
That would be me
That would be nice
That would be no
That would be sooo much fun
That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend fishhook
That would be the work of a Blowfish
That would be weird though
That would never happen
That would really help me out a lot
That would've been cool, (sees Monica) for like a day
That would work
That yeti is one smooth talker
That you are a horrible, horrible person
That you don't stop talking about it
That you enjoyed the occasional drink…ing binge

(They both sit down on either side of him
(They both sit down) Well, I think we're ready for some tequila
(They both squeal in expectation
(They both stare at her
(they both start digging into the 'good' ice cream)
(They both start heading for their rooms
(They both start kissing
(they both start laughing at Richard's poor joke) See, we're having fun
(They both start to laugh, then stop themselves quickly
They both start to strike a pose with the excessive amount of pictures that Monica takes
(they both try to sit next to Rachel but Dr
(They both walk off to watch for Rachel
They called and you didn't get it
They call me
They cannot get enough
They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son
(They continue to ignore her
They couldn’t be worse
They couldn't hit a boat if
They dash up to the admissions desk
" They'd have to go to you
They did it right there on the couch
They didn't even talk to each other
They didn't fight a lot
(they dim) Oh, see you just need to find the right command
(They discover that Chandler is listening) Hey, Chandler
They do
They do don’t you think
They do me
They don't
They don’t have those
They don't know that we know they know we know
(They don't know what to do with their coats and Monica points to the living room) STAT

They don’t look any bigger than me
(they don't move)
They don’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff
They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff
They don't serve donuts
They don't want the bad publicity
(They do so
They do that a lot
The year of Joey
(They embrace and kiss passionately
(They embrace in a passionate kiss
(They embrace in a very passionate kiss
(They end up hanging over the arm rest
They enter and are played by Noah Wyle and George Clooney
They even came with a list of baby names
They even do you
(they fall onto the couch)
They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there
They found a broom in his hand
They found rust
They gave me the shaft all right
They get the apartment back
They get to be pretty loud so Chandler turns the TV way up
(They get up) Wait, so, so you live in Montreal
(They give it to her and quickly take a step back
They give you all the information, it’s uh, it’s like memorizing a script
(They go and get the coffee and the ice leaving Ross and Emily alone
(They go inside
(They go inside and he closes the door
(They go inside) (To the guy at the desk) I wanna quit the gym
[they go in the bathroom]

(They go into the living room
[they go off to Rachel's room]
They got a breakfast buffet
They got a phone in there, right
[they go to kiss but everyone's watching so Ross just kisses her on the top of her head and leaves]
(They go to leave but are blocked by three of Rachel's friends, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne
(They go to the door
(They go to the jetway, Ross hands the tickets to the gate agent
(They go to the kitchen
They gotta be Joey's
(They grab a hold of each other's necks
They guys are sitting there like the Three Monkeys
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum
They have a kid together, y'know
They have another guess
They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close
They haven’t even slept together yet, I mean, that’s not serious
They haven't quite taken yet
They have racquets don't they
They have really lax security there
They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday

[they hug] I'm gonna get changed
(They hug, triumphantly

(they kiss) Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it
(they knock at the next door, Mr
They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done
They know you know
(They lean back all the way
(They leave
(They leave and Chandler sticks his head out
They let the players run the team
(they lift it into place, however there is one small problem, the unit is so long that it blocks some of both of their bedroom doors
They like me more just because I was with ya
They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit
They'll take care of you next door
(they look at her) Right, OK, serious poker
[they look at Joey in the kitchen with a cigar in his mouth, looking at his reflection in a spatula] Joey, do you know we can see you from here
(they look outside) With a beautiful view of
They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them
They make you take an oath

They're as different as night and
They're at the nurses' station
They’re being gay together
They're both gorgeous and sexy
They're brother and sister
They’re buying me drinks
They're craaazy
They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow
THEY'RE DOING IT
They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow
They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds
They’re giving me stuff
They’re going horseback riding

They're identical
They’re in Vermont
They're Joey's
They're just staring at him in shock
They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it
They're just trying to decide somehting
(They’re less than happy now) Oh
they're like a little corn envelope
They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that
They're made of wicker
They're male nurses
They’re maternity pants
They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots
They're nice guys
They’re not a couple
They're not coming on man
They're not even paying ya
They’re not even touching the lasagna
They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning
They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go
They’re not true
(They’re perfect so far
They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King
They're putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel's gonna film it
They require constant care
they're reluctant to get in the blankets
They're ribbed for your pleasure
(They’re right
(They’re shocked
They're so small
They're still in my coat
They're still in their chairs watching TV
They're still just friends, right
They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste
They're still watching TV
(They’re stunned
They're supposed to give me away and everything
They're takin all my stuff back
They’re there to do a job, just ‘cause they work together, doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together
They're trying to mess with us
They're trying to take Joey
They’re twins
they're walking away
They're walking away
They're your backup singers
They're yours
They're your underwear
(They run out to get married
They rushed into this thing so fast it’s ridiculous
They said, "If I bothered them again they’d call the police
They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book
They said they’re gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders
They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being
They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger
(They scream
(They separate
(they shake hands)
(They shake hands and she pulls away suddenly) Oh my God
(they shake hands) Hello, Susan
(They shake hands) So I told her
They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be
They shouldn’t be living in an apartment
(They sit down
(They sit down on the couch
(they sit on the couch and Ross puts his hands on Chandler's shoulder and thigh
They spent $69
(They split it
they sss-still seem normal
[they stand together in front of the TV
(they stare at each other for a while, then Joey blows in his face)
(they stare at her)
" (They stare at her, dumbfounded) Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name
(they start dancing again) Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway
(They start kissing
(they start kissing again)
(they start kissing again) Ouch
[they start kissing] Oh Jack stop
(They start making out harder
(they start shadow boxing)
(they start to advance the giant poking device) Steady
(They start to fight over it
(they start to kiss again)
(they start to kiss and lean back into Monica
(they start to leave)
(They start to leave
(they start to leave, he is still following her) Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more
(they start to leave) Oh

(They start up the stairs
(They start up the stairs again
(They start wrestling
They still say you're a great boss
They still want me for General Hospital
(They stop hugging her to let her out and resume the hug without her
They suck
They suck, alright
They swoop in and steal your jackpot
They take like dogs and cows
They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits
(They then hug and kiss, very passionately
They-they have a liking problem with you
They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love
They-they-they can smell fear
They threw us out
They took Ben to the park
They torn it down a few days early
[they turn on the TV]
(They turn to stare at him
They uh director
They, uh, were infected
The yuk
They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over
They've arrested Monica
They've only been going out for two weeks
They’ve suffered enough
(They walk away
They walk away from each other
(They walk away to get some privacy
[they walk into Rachel's bedroom]
(They walk off and leave Chandler
(They walk off leaving Chandler and Monica alone
(they walk over to a storage closet)
(They walk together and hug
They wanna know if I'm okay
they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see
They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it
They were at a table previously
They were huge
They were in his office
They were like this
They were nice
They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that
They were threefold
They won't all be like this
They won't take her back
They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun
They wouldn’t give me her real name or her number
They wouldn’t have put it there if it didn’t do something
They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it
They would use it to get the mud off their shoe
The zoo
thing
Thing
' thing) Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I'm in the city
Things are looking up already
Things can go wrong
things change
Things change, roll with em
Things change, roll with the punches
Things get a little playful—didn’t you see Personal Best
Things happen
Things happen, and they happen
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain
Things that move me
Things were fine the way they were
thing, there's all that other good stuff
Thing, yes
Think about it
Think about it, it’s a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it’s…
Think I better go before mommy starts weeping
Thinkin' about it
(Thinking carefully) no
(thinking) How 'bout Ben
(thinking) I slept with Monica
(thinking to herself) Chandler’s knees
(thinking to herself) Okay, baseball
Think it'll work
Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him
Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand
Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past
Think outside the box
(Thinks
(Thinks)
(thinks about it)
(Thinks about it
(thinks about it) Yeah
(Thinks) Cups
(thinks) Dark red
(Thinks for a moment
(thinks) Four

(thinks) I don't know
(thinks) I'm not sure
(Thinks) I'm seeing a guy from work
(thinks) I take it
Thinks it's a book
(Thinks of something
(Thinks of something) All right
(Thinks) Ooh

(Thinks) Yemen
Think who you're dealing with here
Third door on the left
Third wife sold separately
Thirsty huh

Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer
Thirty-two
This
This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y’know
This Alan again
This all wakes up Joey, who comes over wearing the mouth guard, opens the top half of Chandler’s door, and starts to complain about the noise
This almost never happens
This and a bunch of bubble wrap
This bicep
This bill for my half of the wedding
This blows
This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing
This company was not built on rough numbers
This couch belongs to us
This couch, is cut in half
This could be God’s way of telling us to eat at home
This disagreement over
This does
This doesn't even sound like a real movie
This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it
This doesn’t make you any less of a guy
This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal
this Emily person
This feels right
This game is grotesque
This guy invented Moss 865
This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town
This guy is so stupid
This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself
This guy's great
This guy's the reason I became an actor
This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have
This hand is my hand
This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you
This has gone on long enough
This has got to stop
This (His video camera) is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say
This hospital is for people
This hummus is great
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way
This is 92

This is a museum, no talking
This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed
This is a nice resume
This is a poker game
This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big
This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing [a pigeon flies in the window and lands on the table] OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go
This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance
This is a terrible play

This is Jane
This is Janice
This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross
This is Josh
This is Julie
This is just
This is just about tonight
This is just occurring to you
This is just so exciting
This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man
This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge
This is like a reunion in the hall
This is like the biggest thing ever, huh
This is like the last commercial
This is like the worst night ever
This is like when my parents got divorced
This is madness
This is me
This is me in The Sound of Music

This is my wedding
This is nice
This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection
This is not, don't be, 'cause it's not so bad
This is not even a date
This is not fair to Frank, (she walks behind them again, and hey again turn to follow her) and it-it's not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it's not good home economics
This is not fun
This is not going to work
This is not good for my rage
This is not my gum
This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue
This is not over
This is not right
This is not the bed I ordered
This is not you
This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV
This isn't camp
This isn't easy for me either
This isn’t even my dress
This isn't funny anymore
This isn’t how it’s supposed to go, there can’t be another guy
This isn’t mine
This isn’t one of those uh, y’know "If she doesn’t come, we-we don’t, we don’t come
This isn’t right
This isn't supposed to mean anything to you
This isn’t take-out
This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control
This isn't what I ordered
This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir
This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot
This is nuts
This is obviously just a big misunderstanding

This is our stop too
This is our wedding I’m talking about

This is so your fault
This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level
This is stupid
This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know
This is the best thing that ever happened to you
This is the boarding call for Flight 009
This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park
This is the coolest house ever
This is the final boarding call for Flight 009
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen

This is the worst Christmas ever
This is, this is fixable
This is, this is insane
This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister
This is, this is me

This lady played my quarter, this is my money
This lily or that lily
This little, old lady lives for my career
This’ll be fun
This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that
This man is dying—(She is cut off by an exploding shell just outside the tent
This man is my God
This means a lot to me
This means something to me
This mink
This money is for the poor
This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment
This must be so hard
This must be very tough for ya, huh (and starts comfroting him looking for a kiss)
This must have cost him a fortune
this night has to go just perfect, you know
This not cool
This old stuff just comes right off
This one definitely goes in the display
This one doesn't hurt either—Ooh, yes it does
This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours
This one, is well, younger
This one's from Joey
This parachute is a knapsack
This photographer, who seemed really dull
This place is a hole
This place is fabulous
This place is really my Grandmother's
This place is so much better than London
This place makes the best sandwich in the world
This playing hard to get thing is not working
This pregnancy is throwing me all off
This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica
This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat
This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him
This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, (opens door) Bye-bye
This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size

This-this other lady is our birth Mom
This-this was a gift
This time it's not so funny
This took you all day
This totally makes sense
This used to be your room
This was all your idea
This was great
This was just in case you pulled a Monica
This was just not worth it
This was nobody's first choice
This was not at all scary
This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment
This was supposed to be a temp job
This was your idea
This was your pact
This way I can break 'em up with a movie
This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger
This where they put it
This whole courtroom's out of order
This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me
This will be your phone
This will just be my batch

Those are dead serious
Those are good eyes
Those are snug
Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm
Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved
Those cute little black ones I wear all the time
Those guys will grab anything
Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor
Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn’t picture myself with any of them
those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry
Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy
Those were like the best seats ever
Those weren’t albino kids, that was computer camp
Though, at least that would be something
" Though some things don’t change
Thought I'd give it a shot
Thought we were trying to find stuff
Though you may haveth anger now
Though, you’re not supposed to take these
Thousands of times

Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men
Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that
Umm, Phoebe, you suck too
Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights
Umm… (Rachel blows her nose
Umm, Ross
Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people
Umm, slight change of plans
Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad
Umm, sympathy pains
Umm, thank you for meeting with me
Umm, that paper’s two weeks old
Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually
Umm, the street
Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me
Umm, they didn’t have poppy seed bagels, so I… (Enters Joanna’s office and sees her handcuffed to her chair wearing nothing but a slip) Oh my word
Umm, this is all because of a sandwich
Umm, this is nice
Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here
Umm, this stuffing is amazing
Umm, uh, I like her
Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys…
Umm, unless you wanna come inside
Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss
Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you
Umm, well, he’s…
Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague
Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together, y'know
Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story
Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital
Umm, well, umm Grandma died
Umm, well, what else could it be
Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time
Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it
Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing
Umm, Wethering Heights
Umm, what's up
Umm, when is your next flight to London
Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you’re going out with Chip Matthews
Umm, where’s my purse

Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer…
Umm, yeah—no thanks
Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they’re implanted
Umm, yes, I can do that
Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out
Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship
Umm, y’know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on
Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, …7

Um, okay, here it goes
Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right
Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then
Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch

Um, thank you for the gift
Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious

Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler
Was, like, your father a doctor
Wasn't it
Wasn’t it
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time
Wasn’t Nick funny when he couldn’t get his match lit
Wasn't that like a year ago
Wasn't there a little song
Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat
Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh
Was she good
Was that a joke
Was that all you wanted to ask me

We
We…
We agreed on Minnie
(weakly) No
[weakly] No
We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie
We all chipped in
We all hate Emily
We all should be here
We already knew that
We also have speaker phone
we always know what you mean
We angered it
We appear to have angered it
We are
We are bad people
We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony
We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily
We are going to Minsk
We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover
We are never gonna happen, OK
We are not going anywhere
We are not going to whistle
We are playing for women everywhere
We are pretty good at this
We are so in luck
We are so over
We are standing our ground
We are switching back, right now
We are talking about Rachel here
We are the hottest
We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever
Weather-wise
We both forgive you
We both knew we had two weeks together, and that’s it
We bought bras
We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid
We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then
We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers
We came over as soon as we saw
We can
We can bring Vegas up to us
We can call it out plane-aversary
We can do stuff together
We can get--what are those--those patches
We can help each other out
We can just look for it
We can make fudge
We cannot let them win
We can still go out and party ourselves
We can talk about anything
We can talk about that
We can talk to Phoebe
We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex
We can't, alright
We can't bring a baby to a hospital
We can't do that
We can’t do that that’s insane
We can't scratch
We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us
We can, we can go to Aruba
We can work it around his schedule so he doesn’t have to quit school
We checked
We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel
we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia
We could be like the Patch Sisters
We could call it Chuck
We could fight crime
We could get that Everest video though
We could have breakfast in bed…
We could have our own show
We could not, would not want to wait
We could put a hat on his head
We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games
We could totally do that
We could use a guy like you
We dare
We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set
We did
We did a little kissin'
We did it
We did not fog Danny
We didn't change
We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk
We didn't fool around with any of them
We didn't know how you were going to react
We didn't order cake
We didn’t think we could make it
We didn't want to have to go and do that
We did you
We’d like to close our accounts
We’d meet, we’d meet total strangers, and hang out with them
we'd never even have to go outside
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach
We done now
We do not have one of those signs
We don’t have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it
We don't have that
We don’t have to
We don’t have to go downstairs
we don't have to go down that road
We don't have to hide
We don't have to move in together
We don't know Bob, ok
We don’t know what could make this go away
We don’t make enough fun of you already
We don't need her measurements
We don’t need that wizard guy
We don't need to remedy that
We don't, really
We don't speak
We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle
We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top

Weird
Weirder than watching his two moms make out
Weird Girl, what are you doing
Weird, weird
Weird world
We just broke up, first thing she does
We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner
We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner
We just got the message
We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey
We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin
We just live in the same building
We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco
We just want you to think it through
we kinda broke up
We know but we're friends with the monkey
We know how expensive weddings can be, besides this may be the only wedding we get to throw (patting Monica on the shoulder
We know me
We know what these are worth

Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone
Well, actually, I meant for me
Well, actually it’s a hockey team, so it’s angry Canadians with no teeth
Well, actually it's just from me
Well, actually, it's not so much a question as
Well, actually just one birthday flan
Well actually, Ross doesn't
Well, actually, she only did it the one time
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there (points to the bathroom)
Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'
Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too
Well, Adrian's looking for a reason to stay, right
Well ah, actually
Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person
Well, ahem
Well Ahh, (he sees Kate and the director kissing) yeah
Well, ah, I'm an actor
Well ah, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life
Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine
Well ah, what can you swing
Well ah, you wanna just stay out there
Well, all American women
Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing
Well, alright, then, forget it
Well, an-anyway, I just—that night meant a lot to me, I guess I’m just trying to say thanks
Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes
Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F
Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared
Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks
Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends
Well anyway, I love you guys
Well apparently Albert has no friends
Well, apparently he scares easy
Well, aren't we Mr
Well, aren't you forgetin' something
Well, are we all together
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe
Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great
We’ll ask Phoebe
Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in
Well, as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren’t going to be here
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing
Well… (At a loss for words, she grabs some of Monica's laundry and throws it on the floor as a diversion to allow Rachel to run back inside and close the door
Well, at first it was really intense, you know
Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade
Well at least, I’m going to mute it
Well, at least I think I do
Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute
Well, at least my cup is half full
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now
Well, at least that’s a great suit
Well at least we know she's a woman
Well, at least you didn’t rent yours from a store called, "It’s Not Too Late
Well, at least you scared someone
Well, back to square one
Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you
Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation
Well, because she loves you and because you love her
Well, because we thought you knew
Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff
Well, because you’d be giving up a baby, and I-I really don’t—I don’t know if there’s anything I can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby
Well because you didn't give me advice
We’ll be eating, and of course, you’ll be wearing that
Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot
We'll be good
Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan
Well believe it baby
Well, believe me, it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung
We'll be over there all the time
We’ll be starting with apples
Well, but aren't you pissed at him
Well, but, but
Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you
Well, but Pheebs
Well, but that’s what he was for me
Well, bye for me too
Well, can I just…
Well, can I talk to you for a sec
Well, can’t you tell her that you are not in the mood
Well, can we help
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play
Well, can you dance at all
Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved basically it's entirely up to me
Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died
Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so
Well, Chandler will be there for you too
Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada
Well, c'mon
Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear
Well, come here
Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks
Well, congratulations, so do you love her
Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again
Well, didn't you
Well did you get it
Well did you try calling her
We’ll discuss it, in the morning
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me
Well, do I have to
We’ll do it all, and better
Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me
Well don't forget that fiches over there by Rachel
Well don't just say
Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential
Well, don't we look nice all dressed up
Well, don't worry, I call shotgun
Well don't you see how gross that is
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys
Well, do you see any babies
’) Well, do you still have it
Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry
Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6
Well, either you break it off with Ronni
Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship
Well, Estelle tried, you know
well, Eva, we've done some excellent work here, and I would have to say, your problem is quite clear
Well, ever-ev-
Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood
Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel
Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl
Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone
Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well
Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora
Well, eww
Well, except for the poem
Well,fall out of it
Well, first it's not a purse
Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together
Well forget it
Well, for instance, what do you do
Well, for some people
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding
Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with
Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you
Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies
Well, freaked
Well, from me
Well, get 'em out of here
We'll get in trouble
Well, get it off now
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet
Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something
We'll give you Janice
Well, go ahead Rachel
We'll go back to Aruba
Well, go hug her, for god's sakes
Well, goodbye Chandler
Well good, here let me help you out
Well, good luck to Dad
Well, good thing you number all of them, huh
Well, go over to her
We'll go to a hotel
We'll go with the burgundy
Well, guess what
Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm
Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex
Well, have fun
Well, have-have you told him how you feel
We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who
Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up
Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until
Well, he didn't tell me
Well, he gets the other one all riled up
Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died
Well, he had gravity boots
Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy
Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now
Well hello
Well, hello
Well, hello, Mr
Well hello, Mrs
Well, hello, Mrs
Well, he made a move on me
Well he made Rachel cry
Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car
Well, here it is
Well, here’s another question for ya
Well, here's your phone doctor
Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord
Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment
Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it
Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign
Well, he's doing terrible
Well, he's finally alseep
Well, he's gonna
Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with
Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there
Well, he stabbed me first
Well, he’s too shy, he doesn’t thing he’s good enough to dance with girls yet
Well, he's very charming
Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys
Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu
Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten
Well, hey
Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale
Well hey, who did these resumes for ya
Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool
Well, h-how is this like that
Well, high school was not my favourite time
Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through
Well, hon-ey
Well, honey, it is pretty competitive
Well, honey that was pretty obvious
Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them
Well honey, what about you
Well, how about a compromise then, okay
Well, how bout just her mom
Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don’t you have to be a dinosaur expert or something
Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe
Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place
Well, how could this happen
Well, how did you find out
Well, how do you find clothes that fit
Well, howdya feel
Well, how-how come
Well, how-how-how is that possible
Well, how long do you think it'll be
Well how would you know
Well I
Well, I
Well, I…
Well I actually, I-I really, I haven't seen her for years
Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that
Well, I am
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I’m exhausted
Well, I am going to, uh
Well I am that
Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
Well, I brought the next best thing
Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went
Well, I can't help you
Well, I can't say any of us were surprised
Well, I can't use these forever
Well, I can't work with people who would do this
Well I, close your eyes, I just think you're gonna like this a little better, 'cause, close-close
Well, I could cut it
Well, I couldn't do it
Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time
Well, I did not know that
Well, I didn't know what else to do
Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away
Well, I didn’t say it; I take it back
Well, I didn’t see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face
Well I didn't tell them
Well I didn't think that was serious
Well I didn’t want everyone to think I was stupid
Well, I do
Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat
Well, I don't care
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number
Well, I don’t hate her, I love her
Well, I don’t have to buy that, "I’m with stupid" T-shirt anymore
Well, I don't know
Well, I don’t know
Well, I don't know about that, (Joey clears his throat to signify yes) except that I do and he will
Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not
Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night
Well, I don't know what else to do
Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know
Well, I don’t know what to tell ya
Well, I don't know what to tell you dear
Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah
Well, I don’t really know what that is, but let’s
Well, I don’t see that we have a choice
Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance
Well I don't think so mister
Well, I don't think this, y'know
Well, I don't understand why Adrienne's attracted to Victor
Well, I eat a lot of meat right
Well, I ended up telling her everything
Well, if everybody's going
Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants
Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will
Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something
Well, if-if she thought they were on a break…
Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy
Well, I figured we’re in another country, so it doesn’t count
Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler
Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you (Points at all of them) with me
Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself
Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing
Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand
Well if something comes up
Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would
Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine
Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am
Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right
Well, if we owe it
Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this
Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her
Well, if you don't, I will
Well, if you don't know I can't help you
Well if you go to Disneyland, you don’t spend the whole day on the Materhorn
Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr
Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it
Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay
Well, if you really wanna know, I'm—Oh
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you
Well, if you're gonna cry
Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for
Well, if you’re on e of Ross’s best friends, why aren’t you here
Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags
Well, if you think it will help
Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can
Well if you want a problem
Well, if you want, I'll just—I'll just break it off with her
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight
Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins
Well I got a problem with it
Well I got his machine and I left a message
Well, I gotta buy a vowel
Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes
Well, I gotta go
Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger
Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now
Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here
Well, I guess I could sleep with her
Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work
Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is
Well I guess I should’ve thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller
Well, I guess now we can't go
Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight
Well, I guess that's it
Well, I guess that's something
Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey
Well, I guess that’s why they call it psychology, sir
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss
Well, I guess there’s no use to me sticking around ‘til the end of the day
Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it
Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica
Well, I guess we won't be warming his house
Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World
Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room
Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky
Well, I have a call in about that
Well, I have a girlfriend, I’m-I’m happy
Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr
Well I have a video, you have to pay attention
Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk
Well, I-I could live without it
Well I, I don't know
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie
Well, I-I guess I gotta go
Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today
Well, I-I-I'm done with this
Well I-I-I’m not moving
Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought
Well, I-I-I’ve been on Standby for a flight home for hours
Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir
Well, I-I know you can do that too
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names
, well I, I mean I haven't ever uh
Well, I-I might've said supergay
Well, I-I—there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore
Well I, I think we'd remember something like that
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental
Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not
Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y’know
Well, I-I wasn't hopping mad, y'know
Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place
Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says—I don’t care about the stupid band
Well, I just…
Well I just came
Well, I just caught the live show
Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks
Well, I just spoke to Carol
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog
Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend
Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had
Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay
Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great
Well, I kinda half to
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies
Well, I kind of
Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel
Well, I know what I’m giving you for Christmas
Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig
Well I like both eggs equally
Well, I like danger
Well, I like it
Well, I like you less
Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too
Well, I’ll be waiting for you, just come up when you’re done
Well, I’ll right you everyday
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me
Well, I lost
Well, I love it
Well I love you too
Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park
Well, I'm also sending out
Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said
Well, I'm confused
Well, I'm crazy about her now
Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host
Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both
Well, I mean, I do have to
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice…
Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card
Well, I mean, I’m not my sister’s, you know, whatever, and um
Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know
Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out
Well, I mean what can I say
Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be
Well I mean, you’re American to start with
Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway
Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like
Well, I'm going to go into my new apartment now
Well, I'm going to kill you
Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or
Well, I’m gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso
Well, I'm gonna go get ready, (Gives Monica the fist thing
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea
Well, I'm gonna go see her
Well, I'm gonna kiss you
Well, I’m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy
Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance
Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house
Well, I’m-I’m Phoebe Buffay, hi
Well, I'm- I'm showering
Well, I'm, I'm sorry
Well, I'm Joey
Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out
Well, I'm just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference
Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out
Well, I'm kinda on a clock here
Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count
Well, I'm not completely satisfied
Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid
Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way
Well I'm not showing you my 'tat
Well, I’m not sure
Well, I'm off to Carol's
Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day
Well, I’m ready to get the hell out of here
Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit
Well, I’m returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H
Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever—(to Chandler)—can't do it
Well, I’m so confused as to what we’ve been doing so far…
Well I'm sorry but you were
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours
Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor
Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff
Well, I’m sorry, I thought you needed them
Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him
Well, I'm sorry Joe
" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me
Well, I’m so sorry
Well, I’m still sorry
Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing
Well, I'm telling everyone about you
Well, I’m there too
Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler
Well, I'm upset -- for you
Well, in a nutshell
Well, I need a whole new wardrobe
Well, I never call me
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom
(welling up) Mm-hmm
Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered
Well, in that case…
well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes
Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed
Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe
Well, I said it loud
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later
Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'
Well, I see you're nine months pregnant
Well, I see you've had a very productive day
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair
Well, I snapped
Well, isn’t, isn’t that gonna be weird
Well isn’t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of
Well, isn’t that a good thing
Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night
Well is she
Well is she, is she the first that you've been with
Well, I started building one
Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning
Well, I suppose I’d have to say you
Well, I taught me and I love me
Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid
Well it couldn't have been worse
Well it didn't
Well, it does not ring a bell with me
Well, it doesn't matter what I would do
Well, it felt French
Well I, that’s the thing, I don’t know
Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends
Well, I then guess I’m going to Yemen
Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league
Well, I think I broke it
Well, I think I can help you get over him
Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level
Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don’t you be my best man
Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica
Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters
Well, I think it's perfect
Well, I think it's very brave what you said
Well, I think it went pretty well
Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one
Well, I think so
Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not
Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little
Well, I think you're better off without him
Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum
Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us
Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick
Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos
Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do
Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers
Well, I thought you liked doing it
Well, it involved Monica
Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work
Well, it just seems like a really small number
Well, it just seems that…
Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track
Well, it looks good there too
Well, it matters to me
Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan
Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things
Well, it's about time
Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out
Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop
Well, it scares me
Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill
Well, it’s getting late
Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna
Well, it's going okay
Well it's gone
Well, it's good news
Well, it’s good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius
Well, it's, it's yummy
Well it's just something to think about
Well, it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive
Well, it’s just y’know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y’know…
Well, it's kinda dangerous
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great
Well, it's like that
Well, it's my cat
Well, it's not a part, no
Well it's not flexed right now
Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous
Well, it's not like I went to Spain
well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know
Well it's not Sean Penn
Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just
Well, it's not that big-
Well, it's official there are no good movies
Well, it sounds kinda stupid
Well, it’s pretty much the gist
Well it's really
"Well, it's right by my house, all right
Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it
Well it's somewhere in between
well, it started about a half hour before the wedding
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience
Well, it's the thought
Well it stupid, unfair question
Well it's very unsettling
Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear
Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle
Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack
Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints
Well, it turns out we need a whole new one (little laugh) because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again
Well, it was a fight
Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal
Well, it was all Ross’s idea
Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know
Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there
Well, it was loong
Well it wasn't that many guys
Well, it was quite large
Well, it was the first time
Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line
Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while
Well I uh, got what I came for
Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year
Well, I, umm…
Well, I've been better
Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong
Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good
Well, I’ve been up since six
Well, I’ve got a girl in here
Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion
Well, I've got to talk to him
Well I've had it
Well I’ve-I’ve never done that with you before
Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right
Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out
Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me
Well, I wanted to be thorough
Well, I want it
Well, I was actually—I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp
Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey
Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else
Well, I was gonna let you play with it
Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f
Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not
Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner
Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert
Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine
Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call
Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right
Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then
Well, I wish I could say no, but you can’t stay my assistant forever
Well, I would like to propose a toast to the woman, who in one year from today, become Mrs
Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone
Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love
Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie
Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game
Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today
Well, Joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since I don’t have the guts to ask him out, I’m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket
Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries
Well Judy, you did it
We’ll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and we’ll be right out of you hair
Well just hold him like you'd hold a football
We'll just quit
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel
We'll just use them to stop the bleeding
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy
Well, Kathy’s last boyfriend was Joey
Well, kinda
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend
Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table
Well, last time I almost got fired
Well (laughing), I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me
Well, let me see
Well, let me tell you something
Well let's…
Well, let's go to a bad one and make out
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination
Well, let’s see, it’s not
Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee
Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural
Well, like anything can be sexy
Well, like father, like son
Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage
Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note
Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good
Well listen let's, you wanna get something to eat
Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped
Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses
Well, look at that, same thing
Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one
Well look, I’m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding
Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right
Well look no further, (shows her the dead one) this one's yours
Well look Ross, you don't have to
Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts
Well, look, why don’t you just, why don’t you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us
Well look, you don’t really like the one from uptown and you’re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both
Well, lots of people
Well, luckily there’s a store here that has one left in her size, but I’m the groom, I’m not supposed to see the dress…
We'll make a list
Well, maybe 25-26
Well, maybe a little
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with
Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings
Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something
Well maybe he's just taking a nap
Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy
Well maybe he was nervous
Well, maybe I am
Well, maybe I am a little
Well, maybe I don't need your money
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it
Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed
Well maybe it's cold in there
Well maybe it's just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life
Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste
Well, maybe it was God, doing me
Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea
Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay
Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now
Well maybe now I’m not okay with it not being okay
Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek
Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip
Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you
Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me
Well, maybe that's my decision
Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me ah sucks
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough
Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back
Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses
Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood
Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club
Well, maybe you could give to somebody else
Well, maybe you didn’t want it to end
Well, maybe you don't need them
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song
Well maybe you should put some ice on it
Well, maybe you should send him something
Well, may I ask for one example
Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel
Well, Mon, I was married
Well Mr
Well, Mr
Well music, and making my own shoes
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it
Well, my eye is a little itchy
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY
Well, my goodness, what was that
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny
Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening
Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks
We’ll need a six-pack of Zima
Well neither do I
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself
Well, no
Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who
Well, nobody wants a ghost
Well no, but um
Well no, just-just that one
Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn't perfect, but y'know it was pretty cool, y'know, 'cause we had all those great talks y'know
Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control
Well, no, not exactly
Well no, not yet
Well, no no, you have to stay back
Well, not
Well, not at first
Well not exactly like the one in the poem
Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in
Well, not just for you
Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice
Well, not me
Well, not mine, but
Well, not myself, but I know other people that have
Well, not playing raquetball
Well, not so good
Well, not that it’s any of your business, but, no, we haven’t, okay
Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac
Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica
Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us
Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing
Well, now, I actually have to get to work
Well, now I do
Well, now we got a reason
Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you
Well now you have two
Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok
Well, of course
Well, of course I am
well of course it is
Well, of course it smells really bad
Well, of course, lambs are scarier
Well, of course not for tonight
Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant
Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay
Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home

Well, thanks, we like him
Well, thank you for giving it back
Well, thank you, Melanie
' Well, thank you very much
Well, that could take a while
Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice
Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas
Well that I can believe
Well, that is a good idea
Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man
Well, that is usually what I would do
Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denying this
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen
Well, that makes me feel so good
Well, that makes sense
Well, that’ me
Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me
Well that’s ambitious
Well, that’s because of a lot of…(She imitates someone picking their nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly
Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh
Well, that's cool
Well, that's different
Well that's excellent
Well that's fine with me
Well that's great
Well, that’s great
Well that's his last name
Well, that shouldn't be a problem
Well that's how I feel
Well that's it
Well, that's it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch
Well, that’s just lovely, isn’t it
Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background
Well, that's neither here nor there
Well that's not a third nipple
Well, that's not bad at all
Well, that's not something a girl wants to hear
Well that’s not true
Well, that's odd
Well, that sounds do-able
Well that sounds fun too
Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit
Well that's pathetic
Well, that's pretty good
Well, that's really a different question
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes
Well, that’s that
Well that's the brilliance of it
Well that's the first time we've said that
Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France
well, that's true,
Well that's uh, that's a good point
Well, that's what we do
Well, that's what we said about Joey
Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right
Well that's wonderful
Well, that was ah
” Well, that was a nice move dumb ass
Well that wasn't easy
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain
Well, that went well
Well that works out good, because I'm not listening
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar
Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one
Well, the cat
Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now
Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body’s always been a little faster than Western medicine
Well the duck can swim
Well, the first time didn't really count
Well, the giraffe's okay
Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years
Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die
Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening
Well, then
Well then ask yourself this
Well, then can we meet him
Well then, do it better
Well then get it, get it
Well then help me get it off
Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again
Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart
Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get 'the fear'
Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done
Well then I can't tell you what I know
Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us
Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C
Well, then I lost it
Well, then, I might as well offer to stay
Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum
Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret
Well then let's just quit
Well then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours
Well then maybe I will
Well then maybe you shouldn't go
Well then maybe you should take it
Well, then talk
Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it
Well then that's it
Well then this is awkward
Well then, (to Ross) what about you
Well then, uh, I uhh, guess that's me
Well then uh, we better make this night count
Well then we’ll get wet
Well then, what is it
Well, then who's been dead for five years
Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad
Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that
Well then you can't have any
Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair
Well, then you’d better tell his other wife, ‘cause she called three times asking where he is
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut
Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps
Well then you're going to have to take her out again
Well, then you should come tonight
Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving
Well, the part's mine if I want it
Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families
Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great…
Well, there goes my whole belief system
Well, there is one way
Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean
Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along
Well, there's a service in progress
Well, there’s gonna be strippers there
Well, there's my favorite client
Well there's not much we can do
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot
Well there’s one (pointing towards Jack) and there’s another (pointing towards Judy)
Well, there’s Rachel, and umm, I think that’s it
Well, there’s really only one thing you can do
Well, there's this one thing… Okay, (Rachel has her back turned to the camera, and Ross isn't looking at her
Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L
Well, there's you
Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don’t think any of them are gonna work out
Well there you go
Well, there you go
Well there you have it
Well, the stuff I just mentioned
Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple
Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me
Well, the turkey's burnt
Well the vet seems to think that’s she’s becoming a rooster
Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know
Well, they always called
Well, they don't have to know that
Well, they go into the chipper
Well, they never have any paper in there y'know
Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that
" "Well, they’re hanging out with Joey
Well, they're Joey's
Well, they're not mine
Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about
Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit
Well, they switched me over to Hombre
Well, they uh, they-they do more than that
Well they were chair-shaped cows
Well, think about it
Well, this all looks good
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man
Well, this has been fun
Well, this is fascinating
Well this is great
Well, this is much better
Well, this is none of my business
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato
Well, this isn't how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty
Well, this is still ruined, right
Well this is the same kind of deal
Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm
Well this one's for you
Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater
Well, this was fun
Well, this was great
Well those are very popular frames
Well, those were seals, man
Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school
Well to tell you the truth, they uh, (Pause) they had a problem with the bag
We'll try to be more careful okay
We'll try to keep it down
We’ll try to keep it down
We'll try to stop by
Well, uh
Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of
Well, uh, Dr
Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other
Well, uh, he's a doctor
Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding
Well, uh, I ate some
Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel
Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3
Well, uh, I-I don't know
Well uh, it's cause he had a thing with, wi-, with the thing
Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I’m not him
Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he’d better come up here and apologize
Well, uh, let's try one more
Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her
Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast
Well, uh, that’s uh, that’s interesting
Well uh, (to Chandler) you not being able to talk may make this easier
Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name
Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs
Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese
Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him
Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one
Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted…tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him
Well, um
Well, um, for the past few years I've been working
Well um, I don't
Well um, I was in ah Mrs
Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too
Well umm…
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat
Well umm, maybe if it had more heat
Well, umm, my Mom’s friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom
Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again
Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric (On the other one
Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids
Well, umm, why don’t you give him a call
Well umm, y'know, I used to play
Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this
Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so…
Well, unless goose is a vegetable
Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture
Well, up yours too
Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho
Well usually

Well, wait there's, there's more
We'll watch him
Well we
Well, we are great guys
Well, we believe it originated here
Well, we both have
Well, we can talk about something else
Well, we certainly are alone
Well, we could count again
Well, we could do that
Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves
Well we did it, we're here
Well, we didn’t have freedom here until 1776, either so…
Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic
Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we
Well, we found a wallet, and we—(Listens) the license
Well, we got into a fight 'cause ah, she said I was to immature to get married
Well, we got plenty of space
Well, we gotta get out of here
Well, we had a table in college
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad
Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive
Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones
Well, we have to say something
Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink
Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby
Well we just wanted to stop by and uh, say goodnight
Well, we kissed
Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel
Well, we'll find something
Well, well I am married
Well, well I can up with it
Well-well, I don’t know Ross—really
Well well, look what you brought
Well, well really it's three
Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns
Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking
Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females
Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes
Well, well, you said it was practice
Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now
Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen
Well, we’re all here
Well, we're applying to a lot of them
Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device
Well, we’re gonna be layin’ off people in every department
Well, we're not seeing each other, so
Well, we’re really not that close
Well, we’re starving, why don’t we all go get something to eat
Well, we’re-we’re hanging out in here
Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me
Well, we should probably get going
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic (Phoebe gasps), in Central Park
Well, we used there’s up last night making scary faces
Well, we've gotta go
Well… we-we do
Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket
Well, we were
Well, we were going to do that after—I mean umm, next
Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true
Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin
Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised…
Well, we were, we were very close
Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale
Well, whaddya think
Well, what
Well, what about his family
Well, what about Mindy
Well, what about my stuff
Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me
Well, what am I going to tell Monica
Well, what am I gonna call her
Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night
Well, what did the police say
Well what did you send
Well, what do you mean
Well, what do you want me to say
Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry
Well, what happened
Well, what happened to your jam plan
Well what if somebody steals something
Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office
Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me
Well what is it
Well, what is the truth
Well, what kind of food is he looking for
Well, what made you make the exception for me
Well, what'm I gonna do
Well what's the difference
Well, what's the job
Well, what's the other thing, what do I think
Well, what's the part
Well, what was supposed to happen
Well, what-what ‘cha got there
Well, what-what would you do
Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be
Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot
Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here
Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer
Well, when you do, just let me know
Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail
Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back
Well, where
Well, where do I start
Well, where is he
Well where's Amanda
" Well, while that's playing he spots Monica playing craps and in victory hug the guy next to her
Well, who cares what your Mom thinks
Well, who doesn't love dogs
Well, who's gonna kiss my sister
Well, who's to say what's true
Well, who's voice was that
Well, why are you doing this anyway
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow
Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment
Well, why doesn’t he practice with a girl
Well, why don't we just bunny up
Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help
Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be
well, why don't you tell them
Well, why do you call him Gandolf
Well, why're you all dressed up
Well, ya know, someone should have called me
Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg
Well yeah
Well, yeah
Well, yeah actually
Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and
Well, yeah, but
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway—umm, what is this book about
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong
Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age
Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she
Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica
Well, yeah, I have one now and then
Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I
Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right
Well, yeah, kinda
Well, yeah, maybe
Well, yeah, mostly nudes
Well, yeah, now
Well, yeah, right, y’know what
Well, yeah, this is the deal
Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again
Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr
Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there
Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my likes and my dislikes
Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs
Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity
Well y'know 'cause Rachel and I used to go out
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do
Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school
Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily
Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants
Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred
Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff
Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend
Well, y'know I'm 29
Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip
Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father
Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us
Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know
Well, y'know, possibly
Well, y’know, sometimes that helps
Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs
Well, y'know, these people are pros
Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume
Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah
Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think
Well, y’know, we were away…
Well y'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy
") Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired
Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime
Well, y’know, you’re-you’re gonna meet somebody
Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way
Well you better
Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause
Well, you can help me
Well you can split it with another credit card
Well you can't fire Joseph
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends
Well, you can't know where I am all the time
Well, you can understand, given how we started
Well, you could actually go to the gym
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him
Well, You could, but
Well, you couldn’t have looked everywhere or else you would’ve found her
Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate
Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him
Well you did a little bit
Well you didn't hang up either
Well, you did the right thing man
Well, you don't
Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal
Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her
Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy
Well, you do want all that stuff, right
Well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too
Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister
Well you guys, I'm outta here
Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you
Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends
Well you, her, I mean, she's very…y'know
Well, you just…
Well, you just must think I'm weird
Well, you kids take the train in
Well, you kids thank Dr
well, you know
Well, you know
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on
Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat
Well, you know how it is, it's that
Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot
Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now
Well, you know I'm not surprised
Well, you know, no suds, no save
Well, you know Phoebs
Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma
Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over…
Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued
Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you
Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room
Well, you know what Chandler
Well, you know, you have to take a course
Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell
Well, you know your insurance will cover that
Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream
Well, you'll have to wait your turn

Yeah, and I don't have any cologne
Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper
Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players
Yeah, and I’m a little tired from digging the hole
Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store
Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version
Yeah, and neither did we
Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions
Yeah, and not put us in the middle
Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses
Yeah, and she's really nice too
Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges
Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like, "Hey
Yeah, and these are my friends
Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl
Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is
Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend
Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you
Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes
Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me
Yeah, and you know what
Yeah, any messages for room 226
Yeah, apparently, they’re pretty good seats
Yeah, apparently they're turning it into some kinda coffee place
Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given' 'em out
Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it
Yeah, at Macy's
Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there
Yeah baby
Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you

Yeah, but at what cost
Yeah but-but-but you liked me
Yeah, but-but he didn't know that
Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down
Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles
Yeah, but even soo
Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute
Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look
Yeah, but I bet it works
Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic
Yeah but I didn’t read anything
Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself
Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now
Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise
Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping
Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you
Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job
Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y’know you can die
Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster
Yeah, but it didn’t fit
Yeah, but it-it-it’s my whole life—you come to England
Yeah, but it's not gonna last
Yeah, but it was different with him today
Yeah, but it wasn’t much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt
Yeah but, I’ve never asked a guy out before
Yeah, but Janice
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive
Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "That’s not how your dad used to do it
Yeah, but Mon that's totally different
Yeah, but not just that
Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme
Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end
Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now
Yeah, but still, cheap shot
Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach
Yeah, but that was different
Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda
Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK
Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not
Yeah, but, there were no suds
Yeah, but they didn't ask me
Yeah, but this is
Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person
Yeah, but uh, I don’t want to be up too late, so uh, I’ll have a decaf
Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin
Yeah, but umm… Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right
Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y’know, then The Plaza for dinner
Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment
Yeah, but what if he doesn’t
Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book
Yeah, but y’know, about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced
Yeah, but, y'know, it's
Yeah, but you didn't
Yeah, but you have to keep the name too
Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a
Yeah, but you're making me look bad
Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life
Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know
Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle
Yeah, calm down
Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in
Yeah, can't do it
Yeah, can't help but
Yeah, can you see me in a place like this
Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum
Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts
Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered
Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography
Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your
Yeah, Chandler
Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team
Yeah, cheerie-o
Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around

Yeah, do you want it
Yeah, drop it
Yeah-eah-ha
Yeah-eh-eah
Yeah, eight of them
Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you
Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it’s going to be torn down, so… I mean, I-I know it’s crazy, but everything up ‘til now has been so crazy, and I don’t know, this just feels right
Yeah, excellent
Yeah, fair enough
Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want
Yeah, for about 30 minutes
Yeah, for you
Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first
Yeah, get out
Yeah, good for you
Yeah, good, I’m let gravity y’know, do its jobs

Yeah, here we go
Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse
Yeah, hero sandwiches
Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love
Yeah, he's back
Yeah, he's head of the department
Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot
Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with
Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man
Yeah, he's really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine
Yeah, he's the handy man
Yeah, he's very reliable
Yeah he was wasn't he
Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter
Yeahhh
Yeah, hi
Yeah, hold on a second
Yeah honey, I'm standing right there
Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who’s had a baby
Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this
Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck
Yeah huh
Yeah-huh
Yeah, huh
Yeah, I…
Yeah, I actually don’t know
Yeah, I agree
Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too
Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser
Yeah, I can dance, y'know
Yeah, I can do that
Yeah I can, it worked real well
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing
Yeah, I can see where I’d be your best shot but, no
Yeah, I can't say croissant
Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long
Yeah, I definitely
Yeah, I did
Yeah, I did, but y'know what
Yeah, I didn't know that
Yeah, I didn’t know you guys were going to be here
Yeah, I do
Yeah, I do know
Yeah, I don't know
Yeah, I don’t need it
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet
Yeah, I don’t want to be the reason you’re unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don’t want to be the reason I’m unhappy
Yeah, I do, yeah
Yeah, I'd really like that
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone
Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore
Yeah, if I have to
Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady
Yeah, I forget which ones
Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy
Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting
Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain
Yeah, if you're really hungry
Yeah, I got stuff to burn
Yeah, I got too excited
Yeah, I guess
Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda…
Yeah, I guess I do, yeah
Yeah I guess I’ll let it go
Yeah, I guess it is
Yeah, I guess it's a little better now
Yeah I guess you're right
Yeah, I guess you’re right
Yeah, I have powder
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him
Yeah, I-I can do it with anything
Yeah, I-I can't -- I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just -- I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift
Yeah, I-I considered that
Yeah, I-I don't care
Yeah, I-I heard
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that
Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh
Yeah, I-I really do
Yeah, i-it's for the museum
Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y'know
Yeah I just
Yeah, I just don't buy it
Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom
Yeah, I just have to get dressed
Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting
Yeah, I know
Yeah, I know but…
Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love
Yeah, I know, but I don’t think that means anything
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys
Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through
Yeah, I know, go long
Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know
Yeah, I know, I
Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago
Yeah, I know, I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller
Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y’know I-I think this is a good thing
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does
Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday
Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me
Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on
Yeah, I know, so what
Yeah, I know that means buddy
Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence…
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you
Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'
Yeah, I like that
Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know
Yeah, I'll be alright
Yeah, I'll go get one
Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee
Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza
Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it
Yeah, I'll take some
Yeah, I'll try that
Yeah, I love that story
Yeah, I love you
Yeah, I'm a big surprise
Yeah, I'm an actor
Yeah, I’m calling on behalf of Monica Geller’s eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today
Yeah, I'm cool
Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes
Yeah, I mean
Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves
Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and
Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great
Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen
Yeah, I mean, you should play in public
Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park
Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate
Yeah I’m fine
Yeah, I'm fine
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine
Yeah, I'm gonna die here
Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe
Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall
Yeah, I'm gonna say no
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book
Yeah, I'm her date
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now
Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here
Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place
Yeah, I'm ready
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it
Yeah, I’m riding the alimony pony
Yeah, I'm sorry man
Yeah, I'm sorry too
Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife
Yeah, I'm with Mon
Yeah, in a poem maybe
Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now
Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser
Yeah, invite him
Yeah, I really do
Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one
Yeah, I really sorry
Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator
Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour
Yeah, I should probably take it back
Yeah, isn't he
Yeah, isn't it fantastic
Yeah, isn't that great
Yeah, is she really 20
Yeah, is there a hair on it
Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed
Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written
Yeah, it did
Yeah, it happened to me once
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know
Yeah, I think I do
Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere
Yeah, I think it is
Yeah, I think I told it wrong
Yeah, I think I've heard of that
Yeah, I think so, yeah
Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me
Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later
yeah, I think there is
Yeah, I think we are
Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts
Yeah, I think we should see other people
Yeah, I think you should keep looking
Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir
Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one
Yeah, I thought it was cute
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me
Yeah it is
Yeah, it is
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long
Yeah it is, it is
Yeah, it is the best
Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special
Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it
Yeah, it's a vase
Yeah, it’s a very large plane
Yeah, it's beautiful
Yeah, it’s comfortable
Yeah, it’s for our catering business
Yeah, it's good
Yeah, it's hard okay, I only have two spots left
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore
Yeah, it’s in the guys’ apartment under the sink
Yeah, it's in there
yeah it's, it's a little flashy
Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute
Yeah, it’s-it’s my only weird thing, I swear
Yeah, it's-it's tough being single
Yeah, it’s just something I picked up
Yeah, it's just so strange
Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing
Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh--
Yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it
Yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there"
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm
Yeah, it's my cat
Yeah, it's really 6
Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick
Yeah, it sure does
Yeah, it's weird
Yeah, it's… Y'know there's—no you may not
Yeah, it was
Yeah, it was, but
Yeah, it was definitely an improvement
Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce
Yeah, it was really hard
Yeah, it was time
Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator
Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that
Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so…
Yeah, I understand
Yeah, I've been around
Yeah, I’ve been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job
Yeah, I’ve discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women’s names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own
Yeah, I've had it
Yeah, I’ve just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone
Yeah, I wanna go to babe
Yeah, I wanted to give that whole ‘Does it
Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing
Yeah, I want my money back
Yeah, I was bummed too
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor
Yeah, I was just kidding
Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars
Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything
Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side
Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way
Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine
Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us
Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on
Yeah, jus' second
Yeah, just
Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college
Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred
Yeah, just leave me alone for a while
Yeah, just like the one in the poem
Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour
Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room
Yeah, Karen
Yeah, kinda
Yeah, lady, I do
Yeah, leave
Yeah, let-let-let’s pretend that’s not true
Yeah, like a chimney
Yeah, like I could lose it
Yeah, like in a cab
Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind
Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this
Yeah, like you’re gonna be pregnant
Yeah, listen
Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet
Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there
Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that
Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep
Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and…
Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong
Yeah, (looks at the tree) oh, but oh
Yeah, looks that way
Yeah, look there's this play all right
Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid
Yeah, losers talk
Yeah, maybe
Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care
Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you
Yeah, maybe, yeah
Yeah, me either
Yeah, me neither
Yeah me too
Yeah, me too
Yeah, me, too, technically
Yeah, Monica's settin' me up
Yeah, much better
Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives
Yeah, my mom got my dad’s season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me
Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother
Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven
Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break
Yeah, my pants are a little loose
Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue
Yeah—no
Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared
Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye
Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it
Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic
Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank
Yeah, no, I understand
Yeah -- no, just that last song
Yeah, no one talks like that
Yeah, no problem
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree (snaps her fingers) like that
Yeah, not since I got too strong for you
Yeah, not the one I had my eye on
Yeah, no, we're gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything
Yeah, no, you’re right, I know, you’re right, I’m not, I’m not gonna do it
Yeah, of course, Donald
Yeah—oh
Yeah, ohh
Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time
Yeah, oh I’m sorry, it must be really hard to hear
Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that
Yeah, oh wait
Yeah-oh-yeah
Yeah, ok
Yeah, OK
Yeah, okay
Yeah, okay, bye
Yeah, okay, give that a try
Yeah, okay, hold on
Yeah, okay, I'll see you later
Yeah, okay, I've-I've been dating both of you, and it's been really horrible
Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me
Yeah, okay, my bad
Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay
Yeah, okay, Scott
Yeah, okay you're right
Yeah OK, OK
Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date
Yeah, ooh, I like that
Yeah, o-okay
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY
Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete
Yeah, or-or to get a hooker
Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke
Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now
Yeah, otherwise, I mean that's, that's, that's just it for us hanging out together
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher
Yeah, pants, what, what an idea
Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays
Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand
Yeah, Phoebe you're
Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming
Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well
Yeah, really
Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before
Yeah, refrigerator college
Yeah right
Yeah, right
Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey
Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie
Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that…garbage chute
Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so
Yeah, Ross
Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking
Yeah, Ross got it for me
Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it
Yeah, Sarah, anything
Yeah, save it for the cab, okay
Yeah, see
Yeah, see, I don’t think it’s gonna that difficult considering this one won’t be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut
Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen
Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh
Yeah, she broke up with me
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love
Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so
Yeah, she's
Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day
Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive
Yeah, she’s got to go back to London
Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab
Yeah, she's here
Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me
Yeah, she's totally good looking
Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr
Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy
Yeah, she was my best teacher
Yeah, show it
Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt
Yeah, so
Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat—I don't want to talk about it
Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it
Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too
Yeah, someplace nice
Yeah, so no one touches the remote
Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down
Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know
Yeah, so we just thought we’d stop by and let you know there’s still no pressure
Yeah, so what
Yeah, so what is she, like a
Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean
Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard
Yeah, stupidly charming isn't' it
Yeah sure
Yeah, sure
Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great
Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same
Yeah, sure, okay
Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there
Yeah, sure-sure, yeah, we’re-we’re-we’re-we’re-we’re clicking
Yeah, sure, that'd be great
Yeah, sure yeah
Yeah, Susan
yeah telephone number of the stock
Yeah, thanks
Yeah that'd be great
Yeah, that'd be great
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here
Yeah, that'd be ok
Yeah, that guy really hurt us
Yeah, that makes sense
Yeah, that one’s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense
Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything
Yeah, that's a big step
Yeah that's better than my way
Yeah, that’s kinda a relief
Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye
Yeah, that's my job
Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there
Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand
Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's
Yeah, that sounds about right
Yeah, that's pretty much what I had in mind
Yeah, that's right
Yeah that's right you are so busted
Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know
Yeah that's the same
Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing
Yeah, that’s true
Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing
Yeah, that was a tricky one
Yeah that was great
Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake
Yeah, that was real
Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want
Yeah that works
Yeah, that would be fantastic
Yeah, that would be great
Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night
Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper
Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller
Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it
Yeah, the hand guy
Yeah, the Knicks by 10
Yeah, the Knicks rule
Yeah, the Knicks rule all
Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it
Yeah, the man wreaks
Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain
Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up
Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem
Yeah, there’s one right under the cabinet
Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me
Yeah, there’s this superintendent’s dance, the Super Ball
Yeah, there you go
Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler
Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching
Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls
Yeah, they do
Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I’m the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages
Yeah, they’re fine
Yeah, they’re going to the theatre together
Yeah, they're mine
Yeah, they're not so bad
Yeah, they’re out of town
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it
Yeah, they still wear underwear
Yeah, they teamed us up as partners
Yeah, they thought I was a whore
Yeah, they were gross
Yeah, they were very y'know…wrestley
Yeah, think so
Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time
Yeah, this has happened before
Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can’t decide between the two of them
Yeah, this looks great
Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area
Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower
Yeah, toast, oatmeal
Yeah, totally
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school
Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red
Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars
Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing
Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight
Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal
Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours
Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it
Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down
Yeah, um, I can’t fly
Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun
Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now
Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay
Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, "Excuse me, hello Miss," so now I’m here
Yeah, um, may we help you
Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right
Yeah, umm, no honey
Yeah umm, they're called wallets
Yeah, umm, you left me a message
Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler (Chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local
Yeah, um, she was 82 years old
Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you
Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons
Yeah, we all have jobs
Yeah, we all know
Yeah we are
Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27
Yeah, we are so sorry
Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him
Yeah, we can rent a car
Yeah, we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all
Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends
Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have
Yeah we do
Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time
Yeah, we haven't dropped it in… (Looks to Ross
Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker
Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it
Yeah, welcome
Yeah, well
Yeah, well…
Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check
Yeah, we’ll be down in like five minutes
Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative
Yeah, we'll call that Plan B
Yeah, well, does he look upset
Yeah, well, don’t expect that to happen anytime soon
Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out
Yeah, well, everybody does
Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one
Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal
Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one
Yeah, well, I don’t dance at weddings
Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot
Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less
Yeah, well, I gotta work, I’m sorry
Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you
Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough
Yeah well, I hear the place looks great
Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies
Yeah, well, I miss the tip
Yeah, well, I’m using noise
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know
Yeah, well, is that better
Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any
Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home
Yeah, well, it's an important day
Yeah, well, it scares me
Yeah, well it was
Yeah, well, it would’ve been, but uh, my parents just moved here
Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys
Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument
Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom
Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me
Yeah, well me too, yeah
Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated
Yeah, well…nah
Yeah, well, now you're kinda not
Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century
Yeah, we'll see
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard
Yeah, well, sorry doesn’t bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home
Yeah, well, sorry, Joe
Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist
Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny
Yeah, we'll talk at dinner
Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him
Yeah, well that didn't really work out too well for you did it you idiot
Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice
Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it
Yeah, well that's how mad I am
Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk
Yeah, well they suck too
Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now
Yeah well unless we tell him
Yeah, well, we'll see about that
Yeah, well, word of advice
Yeah, well, write this jerkweed
Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way
Yeah-well-yeah
Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi
Yeah, well, you don't have your racket
Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's
Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him
Yeah, well, you're wrong
Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch
Yeah, we loves ‘em
Yeah, we played, we watched TV
Yeah, we really missed you guys
Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game
Yeah, we're gonna
Yeah, we’re gonna be fine
Yeah, we're gonna be great
Yeah, we’re gonna go
Yeah, we set up a court in your room
Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you
Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate
Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't
Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so…
Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible
Yeah, we were a great couple
Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad
Yeah, we were just talking about that
Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else
Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore
Yeah, what, do you think we’re stupid
Yeah, whatever
Yeah, whatever you need
Yeah, what’ going on
Yeah, what is it
Yeah, what is that
Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me
Yeah, what's going on
Yeah, what's it about
Yeah, what, so
Yeah, what’s that about
Yeah, what's that like
Yeah, what's the gala for
Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica
Yeah, what's up with that Serpico
Yeah, what’s your point
Yeah, what the hell is that
Yeah, what town are we near
Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do
Yeah, what-what's going on
Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time
Yeah, when we’re in the audience he doesn’t talk to us, but he does wave
Yeah, where the hell is he
Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days
Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader
Yeah, which was nice
Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes
Yeah, whoosh
Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra

Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'
Yeah, yeah he is
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000
Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman
Yeah, yeah, I’m going to be out there spreading joy to the people
Yeah-yeah, I’m one of the cops that won’t work with you ‘cause you a lose cannon
Yeah, yeah, it is
Yeah, yeah, it’ll be great
Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt
Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip
Yeah-yeah, it’s this huge place, and-and it’s got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic
Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so…
Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work
Yeah, yeah, let me show you around
Yeah, yeah, maybe
Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't know
Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter
Yeah-yeah, y’know if-if there was just like one little area where I—that I think we need—we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we’re just not crazy enough
Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend
Yeah, y’know at first I thought we could talk about this y’know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don’t think I…
Yeah, y’know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken
Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill
Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference
Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you 'cause y'know you're my sister, y'know
Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room
Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun

Yeah, you did some real good thinkin’ in there
Yeah, you do
Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check

Yeah, you fogged Danny
Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you
Yeah, you got it right
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip
Yeah, you got me
Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck
Yeah, you hang in there Teddy

Yeah, you know, put chips in it, we'll make like a chip chick
Yeah, you know what we should all do
Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power
Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg
Yeah, you're right
Yeah, you’re right, I mean, we no, we have our fun

Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea
Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin
Yes, and I was saying the actual words
Yes, and she's very supportive
Yes, and that's why we're here
Yes, and the dimmer switch
Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, (sees Monica pointing at her chest) uh, boobs
Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet
Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this
Yes, a relationship
Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism
Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me
Yes because uh, you look so young
Yes, Bunny
Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night
Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too
Yes, but I'm doing this
Yes, but in Ross’s case, they both know in two weeks that’s it
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes
Yes but my mom got me this job
Yes, but there isn't always time
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help
Yes, but this is Pete
Yes but too me he's just, man
Yes, but y'know what
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone
Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon

Yes, every single one of them
Yes, good

Yes I did, and I think you should do it
Yes I do
Yes, I do
Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a
Yes I do, it's just that Ross is
Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches
Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River
Yes, I just wanted to see you again
Yes, I know
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a
Yes, I know I did a horrible thing
Yes, I'm afraid it is
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept
Yes, I'm sorry
Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Yes, I'm sure
Yes indeedy
Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times
Yes, I realise that
Yes, I realize that…
Yes, I really do
Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers
Yes, it does bother me
Yes, it has a head
Yes it is
Yes, it is
Yes, it is, at Office Max
Yes, it is in fact a dark vent
Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport
Yes, it’s a dream sequence, this isn’t cable
Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies
Yes, it's me
Yes it's true
Yes, it's working
Yes, it was
Yes, it was horrible
Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game
Yes it will
Yes I've heard of this
Yes, I want to change
Yes I was

Yes, I was going to incorporate that
Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns

Yes, I would like something
Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey
Yes, Janice
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me
Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process

Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's
Yes, mine's worse

Yes sir
Yes sir, I’m-I’m—(he starts to leave)
Yes, so close
Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here
Yes, some would say that is a lost art
Yesss
YESSSSS
Yes, tell me
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work
Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone
Yes, that is cool
Yes that's right
Yes, that’s very good
Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you
Yes that was a nice place
Yes that was mine

Yes we are
Yes, we are
Yes we are, aren't we
Yes we can, yes we can
Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be
Yes, we did, everything's A-OK
Yes, we do
Yes, we have something we have to get to
Yes, we have to tell her
Yes, well, I expect this from her
Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today
Yes, we're standing out ground
Yes, we should
Yes, what’s the name, please
Yes, while I was in the chair
Yes, yes
Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know
Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating
Yes, yes, do go on
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis
Yes, yes I actually saw him leave
Yes, yes I am
Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm
Yes, yes, I did
Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh
Yes, yes, it does
Yes, yes it is
Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing
Yes, yes it is true
Yes, yes, it's just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross
Yes, yes I was
Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she’d still be with us—nothing about an assistant buyer
Yes, yes Monica is thin
Yes, yes she is
Yes, yes, that's right
Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay
Yes, yes, we had the sex
Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy
Yes you are
Yes you can
Yes, you can, very much
Yes you did
Yes, you did
Yes you do
Yes, you do
Yes, you do want to know
Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice
Yes, you're having a boy
Yes, you said that
yet
(Yet another guy walks by carrying a cup, which Phoebe grabs
Yeti—I mean Danny
Y'ever been in love
Yikes
y'know
y’know
" Y'know
Y'know
Y’know
Y’know…
Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls
Y'know, about what happened with us
y'know, after the uh
Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch
Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money
Y’know all my friends think this is weird
Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side
Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam
Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped
Y'know before it all starts
Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years
Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there
Y'know, botanists are such geeks
Y'know brand new
Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things
Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat
Y'know—Emily
Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice
Y'know, for me anyway
Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things
Y’know for remembering to pack a thing
Y'know, from-from the walk
Y'know…go
Y'know, having fun
Y'know, here's the thing
Y'know he's really upset about it
Y'know, he won't even talk to me
Y'know, hey
Y’know, hey I understand
Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up
Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you’re Chip
Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper
Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed
Y'know how people just click
Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food
Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail
Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff
Y’know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is
Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done
Y’know, I can’t believe Kathy did this too me
Y’know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue
Y'know I don't, I don't need them, huh, I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary… Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together
Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages
Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that
Y'know, I don't see that happening
Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much
Y’know I don’t think you should be talking at all in there
Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong
Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie
Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys
Y'know, I feel like I've lost her
Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do
Y’know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with Nick, and they would’ve ended up in bed together
Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you
Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it
Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick
Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago
Y'know if this shirt is dirty
Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise
Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you
Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet
Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this
Y’know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know
Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up
Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty
Y'know I have dinner plans
Y’know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table
Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here
Y’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you’re up there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man
Y’know, I-I don’t know if I feel right about this
Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore
Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can
Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately
Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again
Y'know, I, I really don’t think we need a canoe
Y'know, I…I really miss downstairs
Y’know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn’t
Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him
Y'know, I just want things back
Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know
Y’know, I knew something like this was going to happen
Y’know, I know for me—(Notices a pair of men’s pants on the chair
Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd
Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling it all that well
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey
" Y’know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right
Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know
Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever
Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there's an age difference between us
Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help
Y’know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy…
Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex
Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas
Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together
Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn't want babies right
” Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations
Y’know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick
Y’know, I’m-I’m glad you decided to hear me out
Y’know I’m-I’m packing ‘cause I’m moving to Yemen tomorrow
Y'know I'm just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache
Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, (to Phoebe) would you, can you finish my set
Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in
Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life
Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store
Y’know, I never saw that
Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward
Y'know I rued the day once…didn't get a whole lot else done
Y’know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs…
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop
Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey
Y'know is that what you want
Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know
" Y’know, it didn’t mean anything, it’s just a mistake
Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it
Y’know, I think if I were going to be with a woman
Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go
Y'know, I think she’s worried that y'know, she’s gonna, she’s gonna be replaced
Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center
Y'know, I thought it would be fun
Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose
Y'know, it-it doesn't matter
Y'know it-it's funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all
Y'know it’ll be like, "So where’s your boyfriend, what’s-his-name, Chester
Y’know it’ll-it’ll be like my very own little sweatshop
Y'know, I try to stay positive
Y'know, it's
Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple
Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms
Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins
Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry
Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head, (very quickly, Joey watches stunned) up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands
Y'know it's ironic
Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey
Y’know it’s just, it’s for the best, y’know it is, it’s… Y’know, plus, somebody’s got to stay here with Phoebe
Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know
Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately
Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle
Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know
Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh
Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic
Y’know, it’s too late
Y'know, it was clear
Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal
Y'know, it was, uh
Y'know, I uh
Y’know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over…
Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just—y'know—stop it
Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years
Y'know, I’ve got an extra futon
Y'know, I've had dates like this
Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm
Y'know I was still gonna let you have her
Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number
Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy
Y’know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so…
Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go
Y'know, I would've bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married
Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag
Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big
Y'know, just be there for her
Y'know, just for old times' sake
Y’know, kinda like a peace offering
Y'know kinda what Emily wants
y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing
Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too
Y’know, let’s, let’s let someone else play
Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man
Y'know like Goldman, Silverman
Y'know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something
Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'
Y'know, like-like write a play
Y'know like you guys were doing last night
{Y'know, looking at it now, they really don't have that similar of hands
Y'know Marcel
Y’know, maybe it’s best that we never got to do it again
Y’know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk
Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal
Y’know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies…
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler
y'know, more like insulation
Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa
Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid
Y’know—no-no, okay, it’s-it feels like everything’s been about me lately, so what’s happening with you
Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend
Y'know now I'm caught up
Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey
Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you
Y’know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before
Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago
Y'know, ow
Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school
Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our (His and Monica's) anniversary
Y'know Phoebe, I'm gonna make this real easy for you
Y’know, Red Ross
Y'know Ross why don't you put that on your answering machine
Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are
Y'know, she may not even know
Y’know she’s gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour
Y’know she’s, well she’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s not fun
Y'know since all the Emily stuff
Y'know since I've been away at college
Y'know, (singing) I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else
Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular
y'know, so what are you doing here
Y'know so you can cook while in the tub
Y'know, so you could be like-like, 'Wash my car
Y’know—thanks
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say
Y’know that little speech you made the other day
Y’know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn’t because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me ‘cause, you’re really hot
Y'know that old guy that lives next to me
Y'know, that's pretty good
Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup
Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student
Y'know that wasn't part of it
Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off
Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance
Y’know, the fantasy
Y’know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married
y'know, the Little General
Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun
Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff
Y’know, there’s not always a lot of agreement the first time
Y'know the tall guy, moustache
Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush
Y'know, the way they were
Y’know the "Wouldn’t it be great if she was my wife" Rachel
Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross
Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know
Y’know, they’re not gonna get married anyway
Y’know, they’re thinking of changing the name of this place
Y’know, they ruin it for everybody
Y’know they-they take a steam together
Y’know, this bra… Really, bothers me
Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me
Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler
Y’know, this used to be my bedroom
Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb
y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something
Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible
Y'know, try to get some sympathy
Y'know, turn and slide
Y’know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend’s a lesbian
Y’know uh, you didn’t really have to help me pack
Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it
Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time
Y'know, we don't have to watch this
Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give
Y'know, we’re here, having lunch let’s get married
Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there
Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast
Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch
y'know what
Y'know what
Y’know what
Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again
Y'know what, actually… (She takes the one he's smoking and heads over to where Nancy and Kim are standing and laughing
Y’know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she’d actually show up
Y'know what are big sisters for
Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here
Y'know what, champ
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them
Y'know what, don't be
Y'know what else I can't believe
Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom
Y'know what, forget it
Y’know what goes good with that
Y'know what, he’s right
Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler
Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year
Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name
Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay
Y'know what I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it
Y’know what, I don’t know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend
Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend
Y’know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is…
Y'know what, I gotta go
Y'know what I just realized
Y'know what, I like Kathy
Y'know what I mean
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women
Y'know what I mean, like dubbies
Y'know what I'm gonna do
Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head
Y’know what, I’m gonna uh, play the field just a little more
Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen
Y’know what, I never would’ve gotten this if it weren’t for you
Y’know what, it’d be, it’d be fun
Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me
Y'know what, it doesn’t matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go
Y'know what I think
Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life
Y'know what I think it is
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he’s wrong
Y'know what, I think we should play a game
Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open
Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish
Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night
Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair
Y’know what, let’s do the catering business
Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week
Y'know what, pretty good
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house
Y'know what really bothers me
Y'know what Ross
Y’know what, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man
Y'know what, that's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have
Y'know what that's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays
Y'know what the best part is
Y'know what this is like
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him
Y'know what, though
Y'know what umm, actually I, I really, I should go
Y’know what, we have to turn off the porn
Y'know what, we're just gonna throw it
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me
Y’know what—y’know what, I think I’m just gonna go home and call Kathy
Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean
Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse
Y’know what, you know what
Y'know what you should do
Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas
Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too
Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself
Y'know what you should send him
Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I’m just, I’m gonna do the same thing to you
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it
Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that
Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own
Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work
Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf
Y’know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn’t have to lie once
Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no
Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made
Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop
Y'know which one was she again
Y’know, whipped
Y'know who also has great hair is Joey
Y’know who doesn’t even like dirty movies
Y'know who I always liked
Y’know why
Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat
Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan
Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually
Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit
Y'know, with us
Y'know-y'know don't do me any favours
Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog
Y'know you came looking for family
y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into show business
Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here
Y'know, you'd think I would've
Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture
Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string
Y’know you just said it ‘cause you saw me there, if you’d have seen a circus freak, you would’ve said, "I take thee circus freak
Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport
Y’know you’re never know what’s gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia
Y’know, you’re right
Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets
Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students
Y'know, yours had a name
Y’know, you should never be allowed to talk to people
Y’know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can’t be friends at work, then so be it
Y’know, you-you also could’ve used uh, lamps and then followed the light
Y’know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around
Y'miss it

You'd better go for it
You deal with it and move on
You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business
