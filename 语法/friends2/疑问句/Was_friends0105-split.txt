Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers
Was all just a way of
Was Emily surprised
Was he crying
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit
Was how you invented the cotton gin
Was I doing anything particularly
Was I not supposed to
Was I supposed to bring something too
Was it
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears
Was it like a sneeze only better
Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips
Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler
Was she good
Was that a joke
Was that all you wanted to ask me
Was that not clear
Was that the cake
Was there
Was there a second of all
Was your basket on top
