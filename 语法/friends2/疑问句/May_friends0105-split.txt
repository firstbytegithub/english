May fifth, why
May I come in
May I have a word with you
May I have the rings
May I help you
May I help you ladies
May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands
May I see it
May I see your boarding pass
May I take your coat
May the happiness we share with them today be with them always
May your Christmas be snowy, Joey
