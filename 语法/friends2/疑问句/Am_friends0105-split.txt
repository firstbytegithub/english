Am I
Am I allowed to drink anything
Am I a Mark, or a John
Am I hurting you
Am I in it
Am I late
Am I losing my senses
Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction
Am I not saying it right
Am I on fire today or what
Am I out of my mind
Am I right
Am I right Mr
Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday
Am not
