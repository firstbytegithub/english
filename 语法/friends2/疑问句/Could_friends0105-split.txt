Could be because I don't feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream
Could be Casey
Could everyone please take their seats
Could everyone totally see up his robe
Could I be more sorry
Could I be wearing any more clothes
Could I borrow it
Could I have a moment
Could I take her
Could not be more terrified
Couldn'ta gone worse
Couldn't be more out
Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that
Couldn't you just stay here forever
Couldn't you just stay like this forever
Could that shot BE any prettier
Could there be more Kims
Could the waiters gather around to hear tonightâ€™s specials
Could tonight be the Night
Could use the money
Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo
Could we be more white trash
Could we drop it now
Could we please
Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding
Could we see something in a slimmer heel
Could we talk about this later
Could ya
Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me
Could you be less enthused
Could you come in here for a moment
Could you, could you try it without the purse
Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble
Could you get that
Could you get us a couple of beers
Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament
Could you just give me the number for where they are
Could you just grab me a bottle of water
Could you just sign right here please
Could you just stop humping me for two seconds
Could you not look
Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me
Could you pull open the curtains for me
Could you sign this
Could you speak up please
Could you try this on
Could you want her more
