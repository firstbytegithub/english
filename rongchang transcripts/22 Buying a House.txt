1
A: Hey Richard, are you busy today?
B: I have a couple of errands to run, but I should be done early.
A: If you have time this afternoon, do you want to go with me?
B: Sure! Where are you going?
A: I'm going to an open house in San Gabriel today.
B: I didn't know you were looking for a house.
A: I am not ready to buy today. I'm just checking the market out.
B: That's very smart.
A: I want to see what I can afford.
B: That makes total sense. Count me in.
A: Okay, then I'll pick you up at about 3 p.m. Is that okay?
B: Yes, I should be done by then. Thanks.

2
A: Good day! Thanks for meeting with me.
B: You're welcome, Ms. Thomas. Please sit down.
A: Thank you. Please call me Jane.
B: All right! Jane and you can call me Dave.
A: I am looking to buy a house for myself and my son.
B: Wonderful! Buying is always a good idea. Do you rent now?
A: I did, but for the last six-months, I've been living with my mother.
B: I see. Can I ask you what you do for a living?
A: I work for the city planning department.
B: That's a good job. How long have you worked there?
A: For about three years now.
B: All right. Let's get started. I'll see what we can do.

3
A: The best way to buy a house is to get pre-qualified, Ms. Anderson. 
B: Why is that, Mr. Williams?
A: By pre-qualifying, you know beforehand which house you can buy.
B: I thought I would look at houses first.
A: That's okay too, but you may be wasting your time.
B: How so, Mr. Williams?
A: You may find a house you really like, but can't afford it.
B: Well, that's when I'll negotiate with the seller.
A: Yes, that's true, but by pre-qualifying, you'll save time, and effort.
B: How is that?
A: You will be able to select a home you know you can afford.
B: Okay. Then we'll try it your way.

4
A: Hello, this is Sam Jones.
B: Good morning, Mr. Jones. How can I help you?
A: I've been working with one of your realtors. I'd like to view some homes now.
B: Okay. Who have you been working with?
A: I've been working with Ms. Thomas.
B: Oh, she's an excellent realtor. I'll check her calendar.
A: Thank you. I'm very anxious to get started.
B: Are you free this Saturday?
A: I think so. What time?
B: She has time between 1 - 3 p.m. this Saturday, the 12th.
A: I think that will work. Let's do it.
B: I'll be sure to confirm with both of you on Friday. Have a good day.

5
A: Good evening. I'm glad you could make it.
B: I wouldn't miss this for the world.
A: Okay, let's get started.
B: Sounds fine. I'm glad we're starting here.
A: Yes, this is a great starter house, and it's in a good neighborhood.
B: Do you know anything about the schools?
A: This is part of an award-winning school district.
B: That's what I wanted to hear.
A: Let's take a look inside.
B: Okay, let's do it.
A: I figure we can view at least four homes today, maybe five.
B: That's wonderful. I'm so excited.

6
A: I think this house will fill all you needs, Mr. Jones.
B: Well, I don't particularly like the neighborhood.
A: I understand you concern, Mr. Jones, but let's take a look inside.
B: Okay, but I'm really concerned about the neighborhood.
A: That's okay, Mr. Jones. We're not married to this home.
B: I guess we can look inside since we're here.
A: Great! Let's go inside. It's a beautiful home.
B: I don't like it already. The porch is too small. I have a big family.
A: All right, Mr. Jones. This may not be the right house for you.
B: That's what I've been trying to tell you.
A: That's okay. I've got more homes to show you.
B: That's good to hear.

7
A: I hope this neighborhood is more to your liking.
B: Yes, it definitely is.
A: It's a little more money, but I think it's a great fit for you.
B: As long as I can afford it.
A: The porch is very large. I think your family will like it.
B: That's a good place to start.
A: This is the living area. As you can see, it's quite spacious.
B: Uh huh. I see.
A: And this is the master bedroom.
B: Sorry, it's a beautiful home, but it just doesn't feel right.
A: What's wrong, Mr. Jones?
B: It's the lighting, and it just doesn't feel right, sorry.

8
A: I'm sorry for being difficult.
B: Not at all. We aim to please.
A: It's just that this will be my family's home. It has to be right.
B: I understand completely.
A: So where is this next home?
B: It's nearby. I think this is the one.
A: I truly hope so.
B: This is it.
A: Wow! I like it.
B: I thought you might.
A: Is this in my price range? If it is, I think I just found my house.
B: It definitely is. Let's go inside.

9
A: Good day, Ms. Andrews. Can we talk?
B: Of course, Mr. Johnson. Why don't you come into the office this afternoon?
A: That would be fine.
B: What's on your mind, Mr. Johnson?
A: I want to make an offer on the 1st Avenue home.
B: That's great. I'll see you at 2 p.m.
A: Hello, Ms. Andrews.
B: Hello, Mr. Johnson. You're right on time.
A: I like to be prompt, Ms. Andrews.
B: That's great. I appreciate that.
A: I'm ready to make an offer.
B: Okay, let's get started.

10
A: Mr. Lee, the seller has made a counteroffer on his home.
B: He did not accept my original offer?
A: Technically he did, but he has conditions.
B: Okay, what are they?
A: He said your offer of $325,000 was a bit short.
B: What's his counteroffer?
A: He wants $335,000, and he'll throw in the appliances.
B: I don't know. Will the appliances have a warranty?
A: No. No warranty.
B: I'm going to have to think about this, Ms. Phillips.
A: Take your time. Counteroffers are common.
B: I need to talk to my wife about this. I'll get back to you.

11
A: Good morning, Ms. Phillips. I have a second counteroffer.
B: Okay, Mr. Lee. What is it?
A: I am willing to raise my offer to $330,000.
B: What about the appliances?
A: I'll take the appliances, but I want a limited warranty.
B: For how long?
A: I think six-months will suffice.
B: Well, I know this seller personally. I think we have a deal.
A: That's great. Are you certain?
B: I'm very sure. I'll confirm, of course. I think congratulations are in order.
A: I'll expect your call then. Thanks.

12
A: This is Joseph Walters, the inspector.
B: Hello, Joseph. I'm the buyer, Mrs. Smith
A: Hello, Mrs. Smith. I've done a preliminary check of the property.
B: That's great! What did you find?
A: There are some issues with this home.
B: For instance?
A: Structurally, the house is sound.
B: That's a good start, Joseph.
A: The plumbing is substandard, the water heater is old, and the roof has issues.
B: You're kidding, right?
A: I wish I was. I'll know more in a couple of days.
B: Okay, keep me informed.

13
A: It's time to go sign the escrow papers.
B: I'm on my way. Give me a minute.
A: Okay, we have some time.
B: I'm really excited about this. This is our first home.
A: I know. I'm also excited.
B: I'm just glad we came to an agreement with the buyer.
A: Me too. That negotiation was rough.
B; But the realtor told me it was common.
A: That may be true, but I didn't expect it.
B: That doesn't matter now. We got the house.
A: I know! When can we start moving in?
B: Soon, I hope. Really soon.

14
A: This is it. We can move in starting tomorrow.
B: No way! Really?
A: Yup. We cleared escrow. It's officially ours now.
B: I don't know what to say.
A: It's time to figure out how we're going to move in.
B: Well, I think we should rent a trailer, and move the big stuff first.
A: Yeah, that would make sense.
B: I'll start boxing everything else.
A: I know of a good moving company. My best friend used them last year.
B: Are they affordable?
A: I think so. I'll call them tomorrow morning.
B: I still can't believe that house is ours. It's a great feeling.
