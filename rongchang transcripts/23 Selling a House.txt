1
A: Now that we found our new home, it's time to sell our old one.
B: I know. It makes me sad.
A: Why is that, Dorothy?
B: I don't know. I guess it's because we've lived here so long.
A: I know, baby. But it's time to move on.
B: Yes, I know. The kids are all grown up now.
A: I'll contact our realtor tomorrow.
B: Are you going to use the same one?
A: No, I don't think so. I think I'll try someone new.
B: Why is that?
A: No reason, really. I just want to check around. We're in no hurry.
B: That's true. I'm good with that.

2
A: It's time to start thinking about marketing our home.
B: Won't our realtor do that?
A: Yes, of course, but we can make some suggestions.
B: What suggestions?
A: I definitely want to have a "For Sale" sign on the lawn.
B: That's funny. Don't all houses for sale have that?
A: No, not really. A lot of homes are just listed on the Internet.
B: why do you want the sign then?
A: I still think it is an effective tool in selling a house.
B: Okay, you're the boss.
A: We'll also have a listing online, so we can reach more people.
B: Sounds good to me. We should do well then.

3
A: Hi Jennifer, it's Doug.
B: Hello, Doug. How can I help you?
A: I'm a bit concerned with how to set an asking price for my home.
B: Well, you shouldn't worry, Doug. We will set the price accordingly.
A: What do you mean?
B: We are experts at this. We'll take all factors into consideration.
A: Such as what, if I may ask?
B: Our formula takes local pricing, comparability, and market trends into consideration.
A: That's very thorough.
B: We are real estate experts, Doug.
A: I think I made the right decision to hire you, Ms. Winters.
B: Well, thank you, Doug. It's my pleasure.

4
A: Hello, Mr. Rogers. How are you today?
B: I'm doing well, Wendy. How are you?
A: I'm great, thanks. So are you ready to make a decision?
B: I certainly am. I'm going with your firm.
A: Oh, that's great news, Mr. Rogers.
B: Okay, so what's next?
A: I have a standard contract we use. You can look it over if you like.
B: Sure I will, but can you give me an overview?
A: It basically reads that you agree to have us act as your agent.
B: I still have the final say on the deal though, right?
A: Of course, you do, Mr. Rogers.
B: I just wanted to be clear on that. Thanks.

5
A: I must admit, Ms. Price, I'm concerned about security.
B: Don't worry, Mr. King. We will provide the security on your home.
A: What kinds of things do you do?
B: We make it look like someone is living in your home while it's listed.
A: How do you do that?
B: We do several things. We stop deliveries, mow the lawn, and set timers.
A: Is that all you do?
B: No, we have our agents drop by from time to time.
A: Oh, that's good.
B: Yes, we take home security seriously.
A: Thanks, Ms. Price. I feel much better now.
B: You are very welcome. Thank you.

6
A: We should start fixing up the interior of the house, Angela.
B: Why is that, Jonathan? Don't we have time?
A: Yes, we do, but the sooner, the better.
B: I guess so. Where do we start?
A: I think the kitchen would be best.
B: Why would the kitchen be best?
A: I just think it's a very important room.
B: Well, yes. I guess we spend a lot of time there.
A: We do. Everyone does.
B: Okay, what should we do first?
A: How about the cabinets? They're not too expensive, and it will look good.
B: Sounds good to me. I'll start looking into it tomorrow.

7
A: It's time to start work.
B: Okay, where do we start?
A: The best place to start is the roof.
B: The roof? Isn't that dangerous?
A: Don't be afraid. As long as we're careful, we'll be alright.
B: But I'm afraid of heights.
A: I'll be there. Like I said, we'll be okay.
B: Okay, I trust you.
A: A good roof is very important. If it leaks, it can ruin the interior.
B: Yes, I know. Remember Uncle Joe's house?
A: I sure do. Let's get started.
B: Okay. I'm ready.

8
A: Good morning, Alice. Today's the big day!
B: Yes, it is. Are we ready for this?
A: I think so. You know I've been working on the house.
B: I know, Richard. I guess I'm just nervous.
A: I wouldn't worry, babe. We've worked very hard on this.
B: Yes. I know, but still ...
A: We cleaned the house, spruced up the yard, and painted the interior.
B: I know, Richard. I'm worried about the things we didn't do.
A: I think we'll be okay. If something comes up, we'll deal with it then.
B: You think of everything.
A: No. I don't, Alice. We think of everything.
B: You're right. We'll be ready.

9
A: Good morning, Mr. Davis.
B: Good morning, Rudy. How are you today?
A: I'm doing well, thanks.
B: So, what have you got for me today?
A: I have exciting news, Mr. Davis.
B: What is it? Did someone make an offer?
A: Yes. I have a serious offer on your house. This may be the one.
B: How close to the asking price is the offer?
A: Very close. The offer is at $325,000.
B: Wow. That's great. That's almost what we listed it for.
A: There are a couple of conditions though, but they're not too bad.
B: Okay, I'm all ears. Let's go over them. I'm ready to sell.

10
A: Good day, Thomas. We have an offer on your house.
B: That's good! I hope it's better than the last one.
A: It is, Thomas.
B: Okay, let's hear it.
A: The offer is $275,000.
B: $275,000! That's $35,000 under the listing.
A: I know, Thomas, but I think we should consider it.
B: Why would I consider this price?
A: We should counteroffer. I think we can work with this buyer.
B: I won't take less than $300,000. You know that.
A: Let's consider the counteroffer. The house has issues.
B: Okay, I listen to you.

11
A: Mr. Smith, we received a counteroffer on your house.
B: For which property?
A: It's for the lot on 6th Avenue.
B: Okay, I've been waiting for this.
A: Yes, and I think it is a very good offer.
B: Okay, lay it on me.
A: The buyer upped his offer to $375,000.
B: Are you kidding me? That's still $7,500 below list.
A: I know, Mr. Smith, but the market is weak right now.
B: I don't care. I'm not losing money on this.
A: You won't be losing money, sir.
B: I don't care. I'm not selling at that price.

12
A: The counteroffer we've been waiting for is here, Mr. Richards.
B: Finally. It's been nearly three weeks.
A: Well, these things take some time.
B: I know, but I wasn't happy with the original offer.
A: I think you'll be happy with this. The buyer is coming in just below list.
B: Exactly how much?
A: They came in at $415,000, with very few conditions.
B: Wow! That's only $10,000 below list. I didn't expect that.
A: Neither did I, Mr. Richards.
B: What are the conditions?
A: They're not too bad. Mostly just to fix a few minor flaws.
B: That's great. I think we'll take this counteroffer.

13
A: Do you have any news for me, Daniel?
B: Yes, sir. I do.
A: That's good to hear. It's been a while since I've heard from you.
B: We not have only one offer for your home, we have two.
A: Are they both serious offers?
B: Yes, sir, they are.
A: Okay, let's go over them.
B: The best one comes from the San Gabriel couple.
A: Why do you say that?
B: The offers are the same in dollars, but they placed no conditions on the sale.
A: Really? They will buy as it is?
B: Yes, sir, they will.
A: Okay. I think we found our buyer then.

14
A: My dad told me he was going to put his second house in my name.
B: The one on Bronson Street?
A: Yes, that's the one.
B: Wow, that's a nice house.
A: Yes, it is. He wants me to start taking on more responsibilities.
B: Well, that will do it. It's not easy managing a home.
A: I guess not, but I won't be living in it now.
B: So what's he doing?
A: He's just doing a Quit Claim deed.
B: What's that?
A: It's just a deed transfer changing ownership of the home.
B: It's not a sale?
A: No. It's usually done between family members.

15
A: Honey, where are the kitchen utensils?
B: I have no idea, Alicia. They're in one of these boxes.
A: I can't believe how much work is involved in moving out.
B: I didn't expect this, either.
A: I hope this is the last time we move in a while.
B: Me, too. I thought it was just a matter of calling a moving company, but wow!
A: That's just the beginning. Everything has to be organized, and packed first.
B: It's a good thing the kids are helping.
A: Yes, and your brother, too. His truck has made this easier.
B: We've stayed in this house for a long time.
A: Yes. It's time to move, but I don't want to go through this again.
B: We won't, Alicia. Remember, we got the house we wanted.

16
A: I think the movers are here, Brian.
B: They're here? They are early.
A: Yes, I know. They're an hour early.
B: We're not ready yet. I'll tell them to come back.
A: No, that's okay, dear. I'll go talk to them.
B: Are you sure?
A: Yes, they can start loading the furniture while we pack the small stuff.
B: I guess that's okay.
A: We'll be fine. Most of the furniture is in the front anyway.
B: As long as they don't get in our way.
A: I'll tell them we're not done packing. It should be okay.
B: It'd better be. They're very early.
