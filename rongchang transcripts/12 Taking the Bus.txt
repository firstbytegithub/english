A: You seem a little lost.
B: I actually am lost. How could you tell?

B: Maybe you could help me.
A: I'd be happy to help.
B: I'm not sure what bus I'm supposed to take.
A: What's your destination?
B: I'm heading to Westwood.

B: You have? What bus did you take?
A: The Line 720 takes you directly there.
B: Where is the stop for that bus?
A: Right at the corner over there.
B: Thank you very much.

2
A: Excuse me, sir. Care to help me?
B: What can I do for you?
A: I'm trying to make way back home, and I'm not sure what bus to take.
B: Where do you live?
A: I live in the city of Bell.
B: I've never heard of that city.
A: I'm not surprised you haven't. It's not a big city.
B: What are the surrounding cities?
A: They're Maywood, Huntington Park, and Downey.
B: I'm familiar with the city of Downey.
A: Would you know how to get there by bus?
B: Yes. Take 764 bus northbound.
A: Thank you. I'll find my home from there.
B: You're welcome. Good luck, and take care.

3
A: I've never taken the bus before.
B: This is your first time? Wow, that's surprising.
A: How is it surprising?
B: I've just never met anyone who hasn't taken the bus before.
A: Well, now you could say you have.
B: Why are you finally taking the bus for the first time?
A: I figured it would be a good way to save money.
B: That's for sure considering the price of gas nowadays.
A: No kidding. Listen, I have a few questions about taking the bus.
B: What are they? I'm sure I could answer them for you.
A: I was wondering how often the buses pass by.
B: They usually pass by every thirty minutes, but it could vary.

4
A: Hello, bus driver. How are you doing today?
B: Good afternoon. I'm doing just fine.
A: This is my first time taking the bus.
B: Is that so? I hope you have enough change for the bus fare.
A: Yes, I do. Don't you worry about a thing.
B: That's good. Just put your money into the machine and take a seat.
A: It's one dollar and fifty cents for the fare, correct?
B: Yes, that's correct.
A: Thank you. There you are. I told you I had enough.
B: Thank you, you're fine to sit down now.
A: Is there anywhere I can't sit?
B: The front seats hold priority for the elderly and disabled.

5
A: I'm trying to get to the city of Lakewood. Does this bus take me there?
B: No, I'm sorry. You're going to have to make a transfer.
A: Can't I simply get on another bus?
B: You could, but you would have to pay again.
A: I don't think I want to pay again.
B: Especially when a transfer is free.
A: How do I get a transfer?
B: All you have to do is approach the bus driver and ask for one.
A: Alright, I will do that right now. Thanks for the help.
B: Have a safe bus ride.

6
A: Excuse me. I would like to get a transfer.
B: Do you have your day pass with you?
A: It's a month pass. Is that okay?
B: Yes, that's fine. Please scan your pass on the machine.
A: Did it scan?
B: Yes it did. Alright, it's going to cost one dollar for the transfer.
A: I'm sorry. I don't think I have enough for the transfer.
B: Is this your first time getting a transfer?
A: Yes, it is. I thought transfers were free.
B: I'll let it pass since it's your first time.
A: Thank you so much. It won't happen again.
B: Don't mention it. Just be prepared the next time.

7
A: What's wrong? You seem unsure about something.
B: I'm unsure of where to get off the bus.
A: Where are you coming from?
B: I got on the bus in Pasadena.
A: Where are you heading to?
B: I'm trying to go downtown.
A: I could tell you where to get off.
B: You can? That would be very nice of you. Thank you.
A: I'm happy to help a stranger anytime.
B: What's the street that I should get off on?
A: You're going to get off on Wilshire.
B: How much further is that stop?
A: The bus is fifteen minutes away from there.
B: We're pretty close then.

8
A: Is this your first time riding the bus?
B: Yes, it is. How did you tell?
A: The look on your face gave it away.
B: I really do look that confused?
A: I'm sorry to say so, but don't be embarrassed.
B: You seem friendly. Would you mind answering a question?
A: No, not at all. What's your question?
B: I'm trying to get to the airport. Do you know where I should get off?
A: This bus actually drops you off right in front of the airport.
B: I know that it does. I've just forgotten on what street.
A: The stop will say LAX Airport.
B: Oh, really. That's pretty obvious.

9
A: This bus is taking so long!
B: You're right. It's running late.
A: It was supposed to be here thirty minutes ago.
B: Just be a little more patient. I'm sure it'll arrive any minute now.
A: We're going to be so late, all because of this late bus.
B: The buses usually come on time.
A: They should always be on time. Don't they know people depend on their swiftness?
B: Just wait a little longer.
A: I'm tired of waiting. This bus is never going to come.
B: Complaining is not helping the situation.
A: I have every right to be complaining!
B: Suit yourself then.

10
A: How long have we've been waiting for this bus?
B: Almost one hour. I think it's late.
A: It is late! What is taking this bus driver so long to get here?
B: Probably traffic. You know how traffic could be on the weekends.
A: That is not a good excuse. Bus drivers should know how to maneuver past traffic.
B: That's easy for you to say.
A: I just want the bus to arrive already. I want to go home.
B: It's bound to arrive any minute now.
A: I hope you're right. My patience has all extinguished.
B: Wait. I think I see it coming in the distance!
A: Thank goodness! I couldn't possibly wait another minute.
B: False alarm. It was just a truck. Sorry about that.

11
A: Wait a second. Where am I?
B: You're in Los Angeles.
A: Los Angeles? Oh, no. I got off the bus too early.
B: Where were you going to?
A: I need to get to Westwood.
B: Just hop on the next bus.
A: And wait exactly how long for it?
B: Not long. I can tell you that.
A: Maybe I should just take a taxi.
B: Take my word, young man, the next bus won't take long.
B: When will the next one arrive?
A: I'd say in less than ten minutes.

12
A: Is this Gage Avenue?
B: No, this is Florence Avenue.
A: Oh, no. I must've gotten off the bus too early.
B: Don't worry. We all make mistakes.
A: Thank you for that.
B: Maybe I can help you get to where you're going.
A: Are you sure it wouldn't be any trouble?
B: No trouble at all.
A: How much further is Gage Avenue?
B: Not too far. It's a fifteen-minute walk from here.
A: Can you please point me towards the right direction?
B: Sure. You're going to head south from here.
A: South is that way?
B: No that's north. South is the opposite way.

13
A: I have so many places to go today.
B: Are you planning on taking the bus?
A: Yes. I'm going to have to bring so much bus fare with me.
B: You don't have to. Just buy a pass for the day.
A: A pass? What's that?
B: It comes in the form of a card that allows you to pass on any bus.
A: And is it just for one day?
B: You can buy a bus pass for the day, week, month, and even a year.
A: I didn't know that. How do I buy one?
B: You can ask for one on the bus.
A: How much does the card cost?
B: The card itself is one dollar, but a pass for the day is five.
A: I only need to bring six dollars with me today?
B: Yes. Unless you want to buy a pass for a week or longer.

14
A: Hello, I would like to buy a bus pass.
B: Do you have a card to use for your pass?
A: What kind of card do I need?
B: It's a card I can provide you with.
A: Is it free to get?
B: No, but it's only one dollar.
A: It's nearly free. Here's the dollar.
B: Do you also have money for the day pass?
A: Yes, I do. How much is it for a day pass again?
B: Exactly five dollars.
A: I do have enough. Do I give you the money?
B: No, please deposit it into the machine.
A: Alright then. There you go.
B: Here's your pass for the day. Do take care of that.
A: Thank you very much. I'll hold on to it.
B: You're welcome. Have a nice day.

15
A: I have never bought a bus pass before. Do you know how?
B: Yes I do. You can buy it from the bus driver.
A: What kinds of bus passes do they have?
B: They have day passes, week passes, and month passes.
A: How much is the monthly pass?
B: It's 64 dollars, but if you're a student, you can get it for 35 dollars.
A: Yes. I'm a student. I think I'll get the monthly pass.
B: Since you'll be getting the student discount, you need to show your student I.D.
A: Alright. Thank you for your help.
B: No problem. Anytime!

16
A: Does this bus stop at Normandy Street?
B: Yes, it does. Is that your stop?
A: Yes, it is. How much further until the bus gets there?
B: Actually, the bus passed by Normandy Street ten minutes ago.
A: I missed my bus stop? Darn it, I knew this would happen to me.
B: Are you on your way to work?
A: Fortunately I'm not, or else I would've been running late.
B: Are you meeting a friend?
A: Yes, I am actually. I'm going to have to call him, and tell him I missed my stop.
B: You should get off on the upcoming stop.
A: Good idea. I'll just walk back to Normandy.
B: It might be a long walk.

17
A: Look! The bus is coming!
B: Let's see if we can cross the street in time to catch it.
A: I don't think we are going to make it.
B: You are right. There it goes.
A: When will the next bus arrive?
B: According to the bus stop pamphlet, it should arrive in about fifteen minutes.
A: We are going to be a bit late.
B: I hope our friends don't get impatient.
A: Hopefully they'll understand.
B: It should be here any moment now.
A: Look! Here it comes!
B: Get your bus pass ready to hop on board!

18
A: I don't recognize any of these streets.
B: Is this your first time riding this bus?
A: No, I take this bus to school every day.
B: This bus always drives by these streets.
A: Are you sure this is not just a new route.
B: I'm pretty sure it's not.
A: Perhaps it could be a detour.
B: Perhaps you might be on the wrong bus.
A: There's no way this is the wrong bus.
B: If you don't believe me, maybe you should go ask the bus driver.
A: Wait, I don't think I have to. You're right, this is the wrong bus.
B: I hate to say I told you so, but I told you so.
A: How could I make such a dumb mistake?
B: You should get off on the next stop.

19
A: Excuse me, bus driver. I have a question.
B: What do you need to know?
A: I don't recognize where I'm going. Where are we?
B: You are on the bus headed to East Los Angeles.
A: Oh, I see. I believe I have gotten on the wrong bus.
B: Well, I'm sorry, but I can't give you a refund.
A: That's fine. I need to go to Pasadena. Can you give me directions?
B: Sure. I have a bus pamphlet for you, too. Here you go.
A: Thank you. I'm new to the area.
B: Don't worry. It happens. I'll let you off down here.
A: Alright. Thank you very much. Have a nice day.
B: You too, and good luck getting to Pasadena.

20
A: Top of the morning to you, Mr. Bus Driver.
B: Hi, good morning. Where are you off to today?
A: It's my first day of college.
B: Wow, you must be very excited.
A: You have no idea how much I am.
B: Do you know how to get there?
A: It's actually just a bus ride away.
B: Are you planning on taking the bus routinely?
A: Yes, I am. Why to spend money on gas when I could take the bus for less?
B: You know, as a student you're eligible to receive a discount.
A: No kidding. How much is the discount?
B: Are you paying for a month pass?
A: Yes, it cost fifty dollars.
B: Well, with a student discount it would cost twenty dollars less.
A: Thirty dollars for a month pass? That's quite a discount!
B: You should take advantage of it.

21
A: Hi, I am here to buy a bus pass.
B: Alright. What kind are you interested in getting?
A: I'm not sure. This is my first time.
B: If you need a monthly pass, it will be sixty-four dollars.
A: Is there anything cheaper than that?
B: If you're a student, you get a discount.
A: Yes. I am a student. How much will it be for a student discount?
B: The student discount for a monthly pass is thirty-five dollars.
A: Alright. I think I'll take that.
B: First I'll need to see your student ID. Then you're all set.
A: Here is my student ID. Thank you very much.
B: Here you go. Have a nice day!

22
A: I'm going to be so late. This bus driver is driving so slowly.
B: Where are you in a hurry to?
A: I have doctor's appointment. I hope I make it on time.
B: I'm sure you will. Where's your clinic?
A: It's in Long Beach.
B: I'd say we're about twenty minutes away from there.
A: I sure hope you're right about that. Where are you heading to?
B: I'm going to visit my grandma.
A: Where does she live?
B: She's also in Long Beach.
A: What a coincidence! Do you often ride this bus to visit her?
B: I have for the past two years. I visit her every Sunday.
A: That's so sweet of you. You must love her very much.
B: I do. Why are you going to the doctor's?
A: To get my routine check-up. Nothing serious.
B: It's so nice to meet friendly people on the bus.

23
A: Hi! Can I ask you a question?
B: Sure. What do you need to know?
A: Is this bus headed toward Monterey Park?
B: Yes, it is. I'm going to Monterey Park, too.
A: Thank you. I was just making sure. I'm new to the area.
B: I've lived in this area for a while.
A: I'm visiting friends. If you don't mind me asking, what are you going to do?
B: I'm going to visit the markets and stores there.
A: Nice. Do you recommend any restaurants in Monterey Park?
B: You should try the Elite Restaurant. It's pretty good.
A: I'll be sure to check it out. Here comes our stop. Have a nice day.
B: Nice talking to you.

24
A: I have to go to Downtown Los Angeles today.
B: What for? Are you visiting someone?
A: No, I have an important job interview there.
B: How are you planning on getting there?
A: I would drive. but my car overheated last night.
B: It looks like you're going to have to ride the bus.
A: I haven't ridden the bus in years.
B: I can help you out if you want.
A: That would be great! What could you tell me about the bus system in Los Angeles?
B: Speaking from experience, I could tell you how efficient it is.
A: Do you take the bus to Los Angeles frequently?
B: Only every week, Monday through Friday for the past two years.

25
A: I want to get to Monterey Park. What bus should I take?
B: If you're in Maywood, you can take the 260 bus on Atlantic.
A: How long will it take me to get there?
B: It will take you about thirty minutes depending on traffic.
A: That's not too bad.
B: Yeah, it really isn't.
A: Are there a lot of people on that bus?
B: The 260 bus can get pretty full except on holidays.
A: Thank you for telling me.
B: No problem. Where are you going?
A: I'll be visiting friends.
B: That's nice. I hope you have fun.

26
A: How much does it cost to ride the bus?
B: The cost is one dollar and fifty cents.
A: I'm going to have to spend nearly ten dollars today on just bus fare alone.
B: Why do you say that?
A: I have to take six buses in total today.
B: Why so many?
A: Three buses to get to where I'm going and three to get back home.
B: You should just buy a pass for the day.
A: A pass? What's that?
B: It's literally a pass that allows you to ride any bus for free.
A: Wow, that sounds like a good reason to buy one.
B: You definitely should. You'd save money in the long run.

27
A: I'm going to commute to school by bus this year.

A: What kind of pass do you recommend I get?
B: You should get the monthly pass.
A: How much is a monthly pass?
B: It is $64, but because you're a student, you can get a student discount.
A: How much will it be with a student discount?
B: It will be 35 dollars.
A: Wow, that is cheap.
B: You'll need your student ID.

28

B: It's easy to buy a bus pass. All you have to do is get on the bus and ask for one,
A: It's that easy? Are you sure?
B: Don't you believe me?
A: I do, but I thought it would be more complicated than that.
B: There are other places where you can buy them.
A: I think I'll just buy the pass on the bus.
B: Alright, suit yourself. And you're welcome.

29
A: Excuse me. May I ask you a question?
B: Sure. What do you need to know?

B: Downey? Let me think. Are you visiting relatives there?
A: My girlfriend actually is the one I'm going to visit.
B: That's sweet. I'm sorry, small talk helps me remember.
A: In that case, let me ask where are you going to?
B: I'm going to work. I take the bus there every day.
A: You must save plenty of money on gas and insurance.

A: Sure! You can then show me where the 260 stop is.
B: Awesome! I'll just grab my bus pass. Then I'll be ready to go.

32

B: That would be nice of you. I just have one question.
A: You can ask as many as you want.
B: I just need to know where to change buses.

B: I'm going to Beverly Hills.
A: In that case, you need to change buses in a few minutes.

A: You're going to change on Whittier Avenue.
B: Thank you, sir. You have been so helpful.

33

B: Yes, I do. You'll need to take two buses.
A: Which bus should I take first?
