A: Hello. I am number G85.
B: How may I help you today?
A: I would like to apply for my driving permit.
B: Are you 16 years old? That's the minimum age.
A: Yes, I am. Here is my ID.
B: Thank you. May I see your form?
A: Oh, of course. Would I be able to take the written today?
B: If you have the $30, then yes, you can take it.
A: Oh, I must have forgotten my money at home.
B: Well, you can make an appointment to take it tomorrow.
A: That sounds like a good idea.
B: Okay, I will set up the appointment.

2
A: Before you take your written test, we need to take your picture.
B: Okay, where do I go?
A: I can take the photo. Stand behind the red line, please.
B: Where do I go to take the test?
A: Go on the other side of the wall, and pick a stall.
B: Sounds good. May I have a pencil?
A: Sure, the pencils are at the front desk.
B: Where do I obtain the test?
A: They will give you your test. Remember, eyes on your own test.
B: Of course. This reminds me of school.
A: Yeah, we get that a lot.
B: Will they let me know if I passed the test or not?
A: Yes, they will let you know after you finish.

3
A: The first thing you want to do is fasten your seat belt.
B: Check. What's next?
A: Check your mirrors and make sure you can see behind you.
B: Done. Should I put it in reverse, now?
A: Yes, ease off the brake slowly.
B: Okay, I need to turn to leave the parking lot.
A: Make sure there are no pedestrians walking behind you.
B: Okay, do I turn the steering wheel to the left?
A: Yes, make sure you are paying attention to the cars.
B: Will do. Do I put it in drive now?
A: Yes, but remember have your foot on the brake and then ease it off.
B: Wow, this seems easy. Let's go out on the street.

4
A: Where should my hands be on the steering wheel?
B: Your hands should be on 10 and 2.
A: 10 and 2? What do you mean?
B: Think of the steering wheel as a clock, and put your hands on 10 and 2.
A: Oh, okay. What about my eyes? Should I be looking at the signs?
B: Take a quick glance at the signs, but always look in front.
A: When do I have to use my horn?
B: You should use your horn for an emergency.
A: What about if someone cuts me off?
B: That's not an appropriate use of your horn.
A: Am I ready to start driving yet?
B: No, you need to learn some more of the basics.

5
A: Unfortunately, you made a lot of mistakes. I cannot pass you.
B: What mistakes did I make?
A: You failed to put your turn signals when turning a corner.
B: How many mistakes am I allowed?
A: You are allowed three mistakes. You got five.
B: Which other mistakes did I make?
A: You hit the curb when you were parallel parking.
B: I thought you might have missed that.
A: No, you also didn't pay attention to some of the signs.
B: Which signs are you talking about?
A: You passed a yield sign, and you did not yield.
B: Can I take the test again?
A: You can take it again on Monday.

6
A: Dad, I passed my driving test!
B: You did? That's great news!
A: Where do you want to go first, dad?
B: You're going to take me out for a ride?
A: Yes, where do you want to go?
B: How about we go get you a nice steak dinner?
A: That sounds great. I could go for a nice steak around now.
B: Come to the house and pick me up.
A: Would I be able to drive by myself?
B: No, you have to drive with someone over the age of 21.
A: Oh, okay. Well, can we drop off my friend that took me to the DMV?
B: Sure, we can go drop him off before we leave.

7
A: Finally, I got my driver's license.
B: Congratulations! Can I see it?
A: Sure. Here it is. I don't like my picture.
B: Oh, wow. You blinked.
A: Yeah, they didn't want to take another picture.
B: I didn't know your middle name was David.
A: Oh, no. I didn't want anyone to know.
B: Well, you shouldn't have put it on your license.
A: I had to. When are you going to get your license?
B: I was thinking about going tomorrow to the DMV.
A: You want me to take you? I do have my license now.
B: Sure! Pick me up from my house at noon.

8
A: Excuse me. This is my first time on campus. Where can I park?
B: There are three parking lots on campus.
A: Can you point me to the direction of the nearest one?
B: Keep driving straight. When you get to the light, make a left.
A: Thank you. Do I have to pay?
B: The first floor has visitors parking.
A: So, do I have to pay? Do they take credit cards?
B: Yes, you would have to pay, and they do take credit cards.
A: How much does it cost to park?
B: I believe it is $3. I could be wrong.
A: Oh, okay. Thank you very much.
B: You're welcome. Have a nice day.

9
A: Sir, is this your car?
B: Yes, are you giving me a ticket?
A: Unfortunately, yes, I am. Read the sign.
B: Which sign? I don't see a sign.
A: The sign above you, sir.
B: So, what? It says that we can't park on Mondays.
A: Yes, it does. Although, it also says that you can't park without a permit.
B: I didn't see that.
A: Well, I'm sorry, but I still have to give you the ticket.
B: Can't you just give me a warning?
A: I'm sorry, but I already started writing the ticket.
B: Fine. Give me the ticket. I'll fight it in court.

10
A: Dad, I got a parking ticket at school.
B: Well, you should pay it off as soon as possible.
A: Where can I pay it off?
B: You can go to Downtown and go to the court there.
A: Can I pay it off online?
B: Yes, you can. Look at the fine. It should give a website.
A: Oh, okay. Let me go get the ticket. It's in my car.
B: Hurry, because I need to leave to work.
A: Oh, wait. I forgot I put it in my wallet.
B: Well, take it out. Look in the back. It should give you a website.
A: Yes, it's in the back. Am I going to pay with my debit card?
B: Yes, do you have the money to pay?

11
A: Do you know why I stopped you?
B: No, officer. Why?
A: You failed to stop at the stop sign.
B: I'm sorry, officer. I didn't see the stop sign.
A: Have you had anything to drink?
B: No, I have not. Do you need to see my license?
A: Yes, I need your license and registration.
B: Okay, here is my paperwork.
A: I will be back. I need to check your background.
B: Sure thing, officer.
A: Everything seems to be in order. I'm going to give you a warning.
B: Thank you, officer. I'll be more careful.

12
A: Where do you want to go eat?
B: I'm not sure. Wait, watch out! The light is red!
A: Oh, damn. Well, there I passed it.
B: I think there was a cop at the light.
A: Can you check? Look behind you.
B: I don't see anything. Wait, there is a car turning the corner.
A: Is it a police car? Well, is it?
B: Oh, no. I think it is.
A: Well, hopefully he doesn't stop us.
B: Oh, no. He just turned on his lights.
A: Damn, I have to pull over.
B: Yes, I hope I don't get a ticket.

13
A: Your Honour, I'd like to challenge this ticket.
B: What is your reason for challenging this ticket?
A: The police officer did not have the right to issue the ticket.
B: Can you explain what you mean with that statement?
A: I was rightfully parked. He told me that I was parked in a handicap space. 
B: Well, was it a handicap space?
A: It used to be. It is not anymore.
B: Well, was there a sign letting you know it was a handicap space?
A: No, because the spot has since been removed.
B: So, did you explain to the officer that it was no longer a handicap space.
A: I tried, but he wouldn't listen. He said I was trying to get away from paying.
B: Thank you. I will question the officer, and get his side of the story.

14
A: I can't pay for the ticket.
B: Why can't you pay for the ticket?
A: Well, I just got laid off from my job.
B: Okay, Mr. Richardson. I'm going to give you an alternative.
A: What do you mean?
B: I am going to have to give you 36 hours of community service.
A: Thank you for the opportunity, Your Honor.
B: You will report to the nearest community service center.
A: They will tell me where to go?
B: Yes, they will give you an option of places to go.
A: Thank you, Your Honour. I greatly appreciate it.
B: You're welcome. I hope you don't plan on returning to this courtroom anytime soon.

15
A: So, how much is the ticket going to cost?
B: Well, it's going to be $200.
A: $200 for a parking ticket?
B: Well, it looks like this is your third parking ticket.
A: Yes, but I haven't gotten one in a couple of months.
B: This is your third parking ticket this year.
A: I know. Fine, I will pay the ticket.
B: How will you be paying the ticket?
A: I will be paying cash.
B: So that'll be $200 in cash.
A: Yes, let me get you your receipt.
B: Thank you. Have a nice day.

16
A: Hello. I need to make an appointment.
B: Were you mandated by the court to go to traffic school?
A: Yes, I was. Does that matter?
B: Yes, it does. Let me have your full name.
A: It's David Johnson. What days do you have available?
B: We have Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
A: Oh, okay. I can make it on Thursday. What time should I be in?
B: Come in at 9 a.m. if you can't make it during that time, please call.
A: Great. I will see you this Thursday.
B: Remember to bring your court papers. We will need to sign those.
A: I seem to have lost them. Could I go to court to get another copy?
B: Yes, go to the court and print them out before you come over.

17
A: Thank you for coming in today. I'll see you next week.
B: Excuse me, instructor. May I speak with you for a moment?
A: Sure thing, Mr. Davis. What can I help you with?
B: Well, about next week. I can't make it.
A: That is a problem. You are mandated by court to attend every week.
B: I know, but I have a family emergency.
A: You have to go to the court and ask for an extension.
B: Do I have to come back over here after?
A: No, they will give you a make-up date.
B: Great. Thank you for all your help.
A: Sure thing. I hope everything is alright.
B: Thanks. I'll see you next time.

18
A: What's going on? What happened?
B: I'm sorry. I wasn't paying attention.
A: Well, I'm going to need your information.
B: Yes, I know. I'm sorry. I was distracted with the car accident.
A: I figured. Well, here is my information.
B: Let me get my information. I have it in my car.
A: Yes, please do that.
B: Well, it seems like I don't have my insurance card.
A: How could you not have your insurance information?
B: I drive another car; I must have left it in that one.
A: Fine. Let me get your information.
B: Sure, call me later on today. I will give you my information.

19
A: Hello, officer. I want to report a car accident.

20
A: Hello. I was in an accident earlier today.
