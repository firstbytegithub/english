A: No problem. I don't know if they're hiring, but I'll find out.

A: I'm preparing for the interview by practicing with my sister.
B: What exactly are you doing?
A: We're doing mock interviews.
B: Is that helpful?

B: What are some of the things she saw?
A: She said that I said,"You know" too much, and that I looked nervous.
B: Cool! That should help.
A: It has. I feel so confident now.
B: Well, good luck, my friend.

A: I asked Joseph if he would get me one.
B: I know he's in charge, but you should submit a form.

B: I need a part-time job, but I'm not doing too well.
A: I'm pretty good at this. Can I help?

B: No problem. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

13
A: Hey, Richard, I could sure use your help.
B: What is it, Jerry?
A: I can't seem to land an interview.
B: Have you applied to many places?
A: Yes I have. I've sent out about 50 resumes.
B: Did you include cover letters?
A: On some I did, others, no.
B: Well, that may be your problem. You should always include a cover letter.
A: Really? Why?
B: It shows you took the time to research the company. HR people like that.
A: Okay, I will. Thanks.
B: You're welcome. I think you will see more interest in your resume now.

14
A: This is the first time I've ever had to do a timesheet.
B: Well, they're very easy to do.
A: You've done this before. Maybe you can help me.
B: Sure, I can help.
A: What do I need?
B: You'll need your employee number.
A: Okay, I'll look it up.
B: Once you have that, all you need to do is log your hours.
A: I have a good idea what hours I worked this week.
B: You need to be accurate.
A: It will be pretty close.
B: It must be exact. You don't want to cheat the company, or yourself.

15
A: Hi! How are you?
B: I'm doing good. How are you?
A: I'm great, but a little nervous.
B: Why is that?
A: I have a phone interview for a job in an hour.
B: A phone interview? That's great!
A: It is, but I'm convinced I'm going to mess it up.
B: Oh, you shouldn't say that. You'll be fine.
A: I wish I had your confidence.
B: Just relax, and be yourself. A phone interview is easier than in person.
A: That's right. I wasn't looking at it that way.
B: Be yourself. Don't pretend to be anyone else, and you'll do well.

16A: I know a lot of you have been working double shifts lately.
B: Yes, we have.
A: I am pleased to say that we have hired some help.
B: Alright! That's great. When do they start?
A: One person will start next week. The others will follow.
B: Only one? You promised more help last week.
A: I know I did, but the search has taken longer than I thought.
B: Oh, no. That's terrible.
A: Don't worry. I promise you all, I'll get some help.
B: Okay, thanks. These 16-hour days are killing us.
A: Help is on the way. I promise.
B: That's good enough for us.
A: Good morning, Jet Office Products.
B: Hello, my name is Richard Lee, and I would like to make an appointment.
A: Good morning, Mr. Lee. My name is Sheila.
B: Hello, Sheila. I was asked by Mrs. Roberts to schedule a meeting with her.
A: Is this for an interview?
B: No, I've already interviewed with her.
A: Oh, I see. It's for a follow-up meeting. When are you free?
B: My schedule is fairly open. When will she be available?
A: How about Tuesday at 9 a.m.?
B: This Tuesday, the 5th?
A: Yes, that's correct.
B: That will be fine. I'll be there. Thanks.

18
A: Good morning, Peterson Industries.
B: Hello, Betty. This is Roger.
A: Hey, Roger. Where are you?
B: I am stuck on the 60 freeway. I'm going to be late for work.
A: Oh, no. Any traffic accident happened?
B: I really don't know, Betty. All I know is that traffic is crawling.
A: I will tell your supervisor you called in late.
B: That would be great, but I could tell him myself.
A: Well, normally that would be okay, but he's stuck in the same traffic jam.
B: Oh no! Really? Okay.
A: At least he'll know your excuse is true!
B: Yes. Thank you. See you soon.

19
A: Please have a seat.
B: Thank you.
A: I am very disappointed in you.
B: I know. Believe me, I tried very hard to make your deadline.
A: I was depending on that report.
B: I know, but unexpected circumstances came up.
A: Unexpected circumstances?
B: Yes. I would have had it ready in time, but the computer crashed.
A: The company computer crashed?
B: Yes, it did. I had weeks of saved work on it when it crashed.
A: So your report was ready?
B: Yes, it was. The crash deleted all my work.
A: Okay, I'll check with IT. Thanks.
B: You're welcome.

20
A: Hi! How are you?
B: I'm doing good. Hey, did you apply for the job?
A: I sure did. I'm meeting your boss today.
B: Today, but it's Saturday.
A: I know. I'm meeting with him at a restaurant later.
B: That's cool. He must be very interested.
A: Can you describe him?
B: Sure. He's a tall Asian, who is a bit overweight with long black hair.
A: Well, that helps. This is the first time I will see him.
B: He's really friendly, and he always wears a tie.
A: Okay, thanks. That helps.
B: No problem, my friend. Good luck on your interview.

21
A: Hello, this is my first time here. I could use some help.
B: Okay, I can help. What is it you want to do?
A: I need to use the database on your computer.
B: Well, I need something from you before I can allow you to do that.
A: What do you need from me?A: I know a lot of you have been working double shifts lately.
B: Yes, we have.
A: I am pleased to say that we have hired some help.
B: Alright! That's great. When do they start?
A: One person will start next week. The others will follow.
B: Only one? You promised more help last week.
A: I know I did, but the search has taken longer than I thought.
B: Oh, no. That's terrible.
A: Don't worry. I promise you all, I'll get some help.
B: Okay, thanks. These 16-hour days are killing us.
A: Help is on the way. I promise.
B: That's good enough for us.
B: I will need you to fill out this form, and show me identification.
A: Okay, I'll do that. I can then search your database?
B: Oh, no. You'll need to ask for permission.
A: Here's the form and my ID.
B: Wonderful. You can ask Mr. Lee for permission now.
A: That's super. Thanks.
B: You're welcome. Good luck.

22
A: how's it going?
B: Same old stuff. What's up?
A: I'm working on this project. Can you look at it?
B: Yeah, I'll take a look at it. What is it supposed to be?
A: It's a presentation on how to increase productivity.
B: Really? This is your project?
A: Yes. I came up with an idea, and my boss wants to see it.
B: That's awesome. Let's see it.
A: Well, that's it. What do you think?
B: I really liked the graphics. I think it's a winner.
A: That's great. I am really nervous.
B: Don't be. It is very professional, and it's a great idea.

23
A: Hey! Are you busy?
B: Not at the moment. What's going on?
A: I wanted to run something by you. It's an idea for work.
B: Okay, shoot.
A: Well, I'm thinking of asking my boss to change the work schedule.
B: Why? What's your idea?
A: It's to change from five, eight-hour days, to four, ten-hour days.
B: Wow. That's a big change. I don't think he'll go for it.
A: It's still 40 hours per week, and everyone will get an extra day off.
B: I don't think it will work. It's not a good idea.
A: Why is it not a good idea?
B: Companies should be open five days a week. Sorry, I don't like it.

24
A: I just read your proposal.
B: What did you think about it?
A: You definitely have some good ideas.
B: Well, I worked on it very hard.
A: I'm concerned about the cost, though.
B: I thought you might be. Here's a cost analysis I ran.
A: It says here that your proposal will pay for itself in a year.
B: That's what I put in the report. 
A: That's impressive. If this is true, I'm certain this can work.
B: I'm quite sure it will work.
A: You have done a good job. We'll discuss this at our next meeting.
B: I appreciate your confidence in me.

25
A: How are you?
B: I'm doing well. How are you?
A: I'm fine, thanks. I was wondering if you read my report.
B: Yes, I did read your report.
A: Well, what did you think?
B: To be truthful, I didn't like it much.
A: Oh, no. Why not?
B: I don't have the time to discuss this now. Let's make an appointment.
A: Okay, but generally speaking, what was wrong with it?
B: I just don't feel confident in it.
A: I can make it work. All I need is time.
B: I like your enthusiasm, but it's too risky, sorry.

26
A: Hello, my name is George. What's your name?
B: Hi George, I'm Christine. Nice to meet you.
A: Hi Christine. Have you worked here long?
B: Almost two years now, and you?
A: This is my first week. I really like it so far.
B: Yes, it's a good place to work.
A: I like how it seems so organized.
B: That's one of the things I like best, too.
A: The benefits aren't bad, either.
B: No, they're not. I especially like the health plan.
A: That's great. I'll be eligible in July for that.
B: You're going to like it here. This is the best place I've worked.

27
A: Oh, I am so tired.
B: I know what you mean.
A: I don't know if I can continue working like this.
B: I know. I've been doing it a lot longer than you.
A: Isn't there something we can do?
B: I have complained about the double shifts before.
A: What has management told you?
B: They said they are hiring more people, and that this is temporary.
A: I need this job, but I don't like these hours at all.
B: Just hang in there. I'm sure it will change.
A: It'd better change, and the sooner the better.
B: You're right. People may start leaving.

28
A: I know a lot of you have been working double shifts lately.
B: Yes, we have.
A: I am pleased to say that we have hired some help.
B: Alright! That's great. When do they start?
A: One person will start next week. The others will follow.
B: Only one? You promised more help last week.
A: I know I did, but the search has taken longer than I thought.
B: Oh, no. That's terrible.
A: Don't worry. I promise you all, I'll get some help.
B: Okay, thanks. These 16-hour days are killing us.
A: Help is on the way. I promise.
B: That's good enough for us.
