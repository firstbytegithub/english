A: Really? I finally paid it off?
B: Yes, sir. Your balance is officially zero.
A: I must admit I am proud of myself!
B: Is there anything else you'd like me to check, sir?
A: Yes, can you change my card status from a college to normal account?
B: Of course, but you'll have to come to the bank to do that.
A: Alright, I'll be down first thing tomorrow.
B: Sounds good, sir. Have a good day.

A: Hello, is this the Smith residence?
B: Yes it is, may I ask who is calling?
A: This is your bank calling in regards to an overcharge on your credit card.
B: I'm sorry, there must be some mistake.
A: It says here that you charged over $500 on it yesterday.
B: That can't be right; I have not used it in months!
A: Are you saying you did not make that charge?
B: That's exactly what I am saying.
A: Looking closer, this charge was made in a different city.
B: I am looking for my card now and I cannot find it.
A: This calls for further investigation.
B: I assure you I did not make the purchase.

A: I'm interested in signing up for your cable service.
B: Alright, please choose the package you'd like.

B: I'm afraid not. This is the basic package.
A: How much is it for the movie channels?
B: That package is an extra $20 a month.
A: That's going to cost me an arm and a leg!
B: You'll also get the premium sports channels.
A: Well, that does sound tempting.
B: If you sign up for our email updates, I'll give you a discount.
A: Alright, I'll take the premium package.
B: You've made a wonderful choice.

A: Sorry about that. I'll give you credit for the three days.
B: I was sold a wireless service unavailable in my area.
A: I see it here; we charged you $5 extra a month.
B: Yes. Kindly return my money, please.

A: Alright, thank you!
B: See you soon!

9
A: Can you cut my hair a little differently this time?
B: Sure! How would you like it cut?
A: Well, last time it was a little too long.
B: I see what you mean. How about a bob cut?
A: Can you work some layers into it?
B: Of course! It's easy.
A: I would also like to keep some bangs.
B: How long would you like them?
A: Maybe down to my eyebrows?
B: Sounds good!
A: I trust you to make me look beautiful.
B: Oh, trust me, you'll look gorgeous!

10
A: I love my new hairstyle!
B: Beauty takes work!
A: And this is your best work yet!
B: Thank you, I'm glad you're satisfied!
A: How much do I owe you?
B: Well, there was the haircut, and you also got the highlights.
A: Not to mention the lowlights.
B: That'll be $45.
A: Prices have sure gone up over time!
B: Yes, but beauty is worth it!
A: When I look this good, I guess you're right.
B: Thank you for letting me cut your hair.

11
A: What have you done to my hair?
B: I did exactly what you told me to do.
A: I asked for a light trim, not for a butchering!
B: I had to cut out all the split ends.
A: I look like a grapefruit! My head is too round!
B: It's a short bob, very stylish.
A: It looks more like a bowl cut to me!
B: It looks fantastic, don't exaggerate.
A: I hate it! I'm not paying for this!
B: You have to pay me for my labor!
A: I'm never coming here ever again!
B: Trust me, you won't be missed.

12
A: I don't have any clean laundry for tomorrow!
B: Well, you should do your laundry then.
A: Laundry is such a hassle!
B: Pack the laundry bags and let's go to the Laundromat.
A: Oh, alright. I don't have much, though.
B: Do you have any quarters?
A: Yes. I have enough for the washer and dryer.
B: Alright then, let's get going.
A: This is going to take forever.
B: The longer you keep complaining, the longer it'll feel.
A: I'd rather be playing video games.
B: I'd rather you wore a clean shirt to school tomorrow.

13
A: Put your wet clothes into the dryer, please!
B: How long should I put them in for?
A: Put them on low heat for thirty minutes.
B: Why low heat?
A: If the air is too hot, the clothes will shrink.
B: I need to wash another load of laundry.
A: If they're colored, wash them in cold water.
B: Does warm water make them fade?
A: Yes. Put the detergent here, and don't use bleach.
B: Oh, that's where to put the detergent.
A: Don't forget to add fabric softener after the first rinse.
B: Okay, I won't. Thanks.

14
A: Excuse me. Can I borrow your fabric softener?
B: Of course, take as much as you need.
A: Thank you. You're very kind.
B: It's no problem at all.
A: I love the subtle smell of this brand!
B: Me too! It's not overpowering or strong.
A: I think maybe I'll buy it for myself, too.
B: What I like about it is that it's hypoallergenic.
A: No kidding? That's really something.
B: It's perfect for washing delicate clothing.
A: Well, thank you for introducing me to this brand!
B: Anytime, no problem!

15
A: Sarah! Hurry up and get out of bed!
B: I can't, the blankets won't let me go.
A: Quit being lazy and get up!
B: No, I have to finish my awesome dream!
A: I can't believe you turned off your alarm this morning.
B: Why? I do it every morning.
A: If you don't get out of bed, you'll get to school late.
B: That's not so bad.
A: How is it not so bad?
B: Sleep is good for growing children.
A: Yes, but you have a math test this morning!
B: I completely forgot! I'm up, I'm up!

16
A: Hello, is this Mr. Smith? I'm Mrs. Jones.
B: Hello, Mrs. Jones. Did you get my message?
A: Yes, I did, I'm returning your call.
B: Oh, right, of course.
A: What's the problem? Is James in trouble?
B: I caught him copying a classmate's test today.
A: Oh, that child is incorrigible!
B: I'm afraid I'll have to give him detention this time.
A: It's alright, I understand.
B: James certainly is strong-willed.
A: Yes, he needs a firm hand and discipline!
B: He's a good boy. Now if only he'd stop cheating!

17
A: Hello, Mr. Smith. It's nice to finally meet you.
B: Likewise, Mrs. Jones. Please sit down.
A: Is James in trouble again?
B: Actually, no, he's not.
A: What's the purpose of this meeting exactly?
B: I just wanted to let you know that James is doing very well.
A: Oh, is that right? I'm so proud!
B: He has been staying for tutoring and his marks have skyrocketed!
A: I always knew he had it in him!
B: He behaves better in the classroom, too.
A: I do believe my James is growing up!
B: All children need to mature is motivation!

18
A: You need to try harder in school!
B: I am doing well in school.
A: Then why are your marks in science so low?
B: I don't understand science, that's all.
A: Is that the same reasoning you have for math?
B: Yes, and English, too.
A: Tell me one single subject you're doing well in.
B: Well, I'm doing wonderfully in my music class.
A: What about history?
B: Only the parts about Woodstock.
A: That's it! You're grounded! No guitar for a month.
B: Great, now I'll surely have a low GPA.

19
A: Children, it's time to go to bed!
B: But we're not sleepy yet!
A: If you get into bed right now, I'll read you a fairytale.
B: One with a princess and a prince?
A: Of course, and a magical dragon, too.
B: Why do we hear fairytales before bed?
A: So that the magic from stories can grow while you're sleeping.
B: What does it grow into?
A: Why, magical dreams, of course!
B: Please read us two tonight!
A: Alright, but only if you sleep as soon as I'm done!
B: We will. It's a promise!

20
A: David! Clean your room. It's filthy!
B: It's not so bad, mom.
A: I don't even remember what color the carpet is!
B: It's blue, I remember.
A: Have you no shame?
B: What should I be ashamed of?
A: There are clothes all over the ground!
B: It's just easier to leave them there.
A: Your floor is not a gigantic closet.
B: I never said it was.
A: Clean your room or you can't go out today.
B: Fine, fine. I'll clean it now.

21
A: I think these puppies are hungry!
B: They've done nothing but play all day.
A: Do you think they're old enough to eat kibble?
B: They're six weeks old; I think they're old enough.
A: Look! They're digging right in!
B: Now they're settling for a nap.
A: Between keeping them from chewing things and cleaning, they're a hassle.
B: Yeah, they are. But look how cute they are while asleep!
A: Suddenly, I don't mind the chores so much.
B: Yeah, neither do I.
A: These puppies are truly worth it.
B: I wouldn't lose a single minute with them.

22
A: What's for dinner?
B: I should be asking you that.
A: What? Why do you say that?
B: You're old enough to cook dinner.
A: Are you saying it's my turn now?
B: Actually, that's exactly what I'm saying.
A: What would you like to eat, then?
B: I'm craving some spaghetti, bread, and even a salad.
A: Frozen pizza it is, then!
B: You are so lazy! Can you even cook?
A: Of course I can cook! I choose not to.
B: You're having hot pockets for dinner tomorrow.
