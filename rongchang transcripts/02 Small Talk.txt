1
A: Hello, how are you doing?
B: I am doing quite well, how are you?
A: I've been better. I'm completely swamped with work.
B: I know the feeling. My boss works me hard, too.
A: Enough about work. How are the kids?
B: They are good. The oldest is about to graduate from high school.
A: You're kidding me! That's great, man.
B: The youngest is about to start middle school soon.
A: My son is about to start middle school as well.
B: Hey, maybe they will be classmates.
A: It's a strong possibility.
B: Yeah. Well, I want to try and beat the traffic. Good-bye.
A: Have a good one.

2
A: Good morning. How are you today?
B: I'm fantastic. How about yourself?
A: That's great! I'm good, but I feel a little sick.
B: That's not good. I heard there is a flu going around.
A: Well, I have to be sure to take good care of myself.
B: Sucks that you aren't feeling well, it's a nice day.
A: It is. The sunshine makes me want to go to the beach.
B: That's a great idea, but I think you'll get sicker if you go.
A: True. Perhaps we can go some other time?
B: For sure. Let's get together next week and go if you're better.
A: Sounds like a plan. I'll talk to you later.
B: Cool, see you later.

3
A: Everything is going wrong today.
B: Well, at least the weather is nice.
A: Oh, yeah. Imagine if it had rained like they said it would.
B: I know, I would have gotten soaked walking home.
A: Yeah, I love when the sun is shining, but it's not too hot.
B: I do, too. This weather is pretty sweet.
A: I guess everything will be okay in the end.
B: So all you needed was some sunshine.
A: Yeah, I guess you were right – for once.
B: Hey! I'm always right.

4
A: Quick! Get in here and wait out the storm!
B: Oh, my word. Thank you so much.
A: It's raining cats and dogs out there.
B: More like lions and wolves!
A: I was watching the news.
B: What did they say?
A: This is going to be one heck of a storm.
B: Should we be worried?
A: I don't think so. The emergency alert system would have gone up.
B: True. Well, thank you for saving me from this storm.
A: No problem. I'm making some tea; would you like some?
B: Please. Something warm would be great at the moment!

5
A: Heard it's supposed to rain.
B: Where did you hear that from?
A: The news. The weatherman said there is a high probability of rain.
B: Since when have you started watching the news?
A: I've always watched the news. Well, at least to check out the weather.
B: What else did they say about the weekend?
A: I think they said it was going to rain throughout the weekend.
B: Throughout the weekend? Don't pull my chain.
A: I'm not. They said it, not me. I know you had plans.
B: Well, I don't believe it. Just like I don't believe you watch the news.
A: Okay, suit yourself. I'd take an umbrella though.
B: I won't. I'd rather get wet than listen to you.

6
A: Why don't you ever answer your phone?
B: I'm usually busy. What's up?
A: I wanted to see if you were down to kick it.
B: Where do you want to go? I don't have that much money.
A: Let's go for a drink at the bar where we went last week.
B: Okay, but I only have enough for three beers.
A: It's fine. I'll pay for the rest, but you owe me.
B: Screw that, I paid for you last time. You owe me!
A: Well, then we can call it even.
B: I guess so. Where should we meet?
A: How about at the train station by the bar?
B: Sounds good. I'll see you in an hour.
A: Great. See you then, laters.

7
A: Dude, I forgot to tell you – I'm going out with Sarah.
B: Which one is Sarah? You date so many girls that I get confused.
A: First off, I don't date that many girls, and secondly you're always confused.
B: True. So, which one is she? Is she in your class?
A: Nope. She's the girl from the restaurant we go to in downtown.
B: From Green Bamboo? Which girl?
A: The cute one. You know the one with the tattoo up her thigh?
B: I think I would have noticed that.
A: She's the only one with blonde hair.
B: Well, why didn't you just say that? That's Sarah?
A: Well, I know you check her out. I assumed you saw the tattoo.
B: I'm not that big of a pervert.

8
A: I have a new co-worker at work. She's pretty.
B: Oh, yeah? Is she prettier than your ex-girlfriend?
A: Yeah, she is. She's tall, thin, and wears glasses.
B: Oh, boy. What is it with you and girls with glasses?
A: You know what? I don't know.
B: Well, tell me about her.
A: She likes music. She is always wearing band t-shirts.
B: Really? Are they any bands you like?
A: Yeah, actually a lot of them are.
B: How does she act? Is she nice?
A: She is. I dropped my wallet, and didn't notice. She took it to me.
B: Well, ask her out tomorrow, or somebody will.

9
A: I heard that your brother is in the hospital.
B: Yeah. He's been there since last week.
A: Oh, no. What happened? Is he alright?
B: He got in a car accident. He should be alright.
A: The doctors told you he would be alright?
B: Yes, but they need to keep him for further tests.
A: Oh, okay. I was so worried when I heard this.
B: Thanks, but everything should be fine. He was lucky.
A: Really lucky. Did anyone else get injured?
B: His girlfriend broke her arm, but that's all.
A: Oh, that's not good. Is she at the hospital?
B: Yes, she is taking care of my brother.

10
A: C'mon, guess what?
B: I don't know, chicken butt?
A: Stop playing games. I got the part in the school play!
B: Really? That's great!
A: All this practice is finally paying off.
B: Yes, it is. I can't believe it!
A: Same here. I'm going to be the main character!
B: I'm so proud of you. I can't wait to see the play.
A: It's going to be a lot of hard work, but I'm glad I got the part.
B: When does the play open?
A: It opens in three weeks.
B: Great. Get me a ticket. I want to be sitting in the front row.

11
A: That's an awesome shirt.
B: Thank you. It's so nice of you to say.
A: Where did you get it?
B: I got it at a store at the mall.
A: The mall? Did it cost a lot? Things are usually overpriced there.
B: Actually, it was quite cheap. I got it for $15.99.
A: That is pretty cheap. Do they have it in other colors?
B: You want to go get one?
A: Yeah, I like how it looks. Would you want to come with me?
B: We can go after school, if you want?
A: That would be great. I need new clothes, but I don't know what to buy.
B: I'll help you pick out something cute.

12
A: I'm bored. Do you want to do something?
B: What did you have in mind?
A: Do you want to go drink?
B: No, I have work tomorrow, and I don't want to be hung over.
A: You don't have to get wasted.
B: I know you. You won't shut your mouth until I get wasted.
A: Fine. Let's go to the record store. I hear they have new vinyl.
B: I'm down to go to the record store. I haven't been there in a while.
A: Actually, I don't feel like going to the record store.
B: Well, what do you want to do?
A: Let's go to the movies instead?
B: Yeah, that new movie that I want to see is out. Let's go.

13
A: What's your favorite movie?
B: "The Grand Budapest Hotel." Why do you ask?
A: I was wondering what types of movies you liked.
B: Well, that's my favorite movie, but I like all sorts of movies.
A: Oh, okay, but why do you like that movie so much?
B: Because it has action, adventure, comedy, and wonderful acting.
A: How many times would you say you have seen it?
B: Too many to say. I watch it at least twice a month.
A: Really, you like it that much?
B: It's a really good movie. You should watch it.
A: Could I borrow it? I don't have money to buy it.
B: Yes, I could lend you the movie, but be careful with it.

14
A: Do you have a favorite genre of music?
B: No, but I have favorite bands.
A: What bands would you consider your favorites?
B: The Beatles are the first. Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros are the second.
A: Is that all?
B: No, I really like The Clash. They are third.
A: I've only heard of The Beatles.
B: You should check out the other two bands. They are good.
A: Do you have any of their music that you could show me?
B: Sure, come over to my house after school, and I will show you their music. 
A: Great! I've been looking for new music to listen to.
B: Don't worry; I will get you into a lot of new stuff.

15
A: Do you know who won against the Dodgers and the Cubs?
B: I'm sorry, but I don't follow baseball.
A: Oh, really? Why not?
B: I've never really got into baseball. I like basketball better.
A: Oh, okay. Do you have a cell phone?
B: Yes, why do you ask?
A: Could you check to see who won the baseball game?
B: Sure, let me check. It'll take one minute. It looks like the Chicago Cubs won seven to three.
A: Yes! I was rooting for the Cubs.
B: Well, they won. Glad I could be of some service.
A: Thanks again. Have a nice day.

16
A: My baseball game starts at 2 p.m. today. Will you be there?
B: Yes, I will definitely be there.
A: Great! I will tell my family to save you a seat.
B: What position will you be playing?
A: I will be playing first base, but the coach may switch me.
B: If he switches you, what position will you play?
A: I think he wants me to pitch.
B: You are a pitcher as well?
A: Yes, I am. I'm still training, but I can throw.
B: I didn't know that about you.
A: Well, hopefully you can see me pitch today.
B: Awesome! I can't wait.

17
A: Can you explain baseball to me?
B: I can try to explain the basics. What do you want to know?
A: What are strikes?
B: Every batter has three strikes. When they get three strikes, they are out. 
A: Okay, but what about when the umpire calls a ball?
B: Once an umpire calls four balls, then the batter goes to first base.
A: What happens when a pitcher hits a batter with the ball?
B: The batter goes to first base.
A: What if someone is on first base?
B: Then whoever was on first base goes to second base.
A: Oh, okay. What's a no-hitter?
B: A no-hitter is when a team doesn't get a hit throughout the game.
A: So, that's a good thing for the pitcher?
B: Yes, because that means he pitched really well.

18
A: Would you like to go see a movie tomorrow night?
B: I am busy tomorrow night, but I am free the night after.
A: That's great! What time should I pick you up?
B: 8 p.m. would be great.
A: Well, 8 p.m. it is. What movie would you like to see?
B: I'm not sure. Which movies are out right now?
A: I actually don't know. How about we choose when we get there?
B: Sure thing, that sounds great.
A: Okay, should I pick you up at your house? Or do you want to meet somewhere?
B: I live by school; if you want, we could meet there.
A: Sure. I drive a white Nissan Sentra. I'll text you later on, okay?
B: That sounds great. I'll be waiting for your text.

19
A: Would you like to donate money for Christopher?
B: Wait, what happened to Christopher?
A: He was hit by a car after school the other day.
B: What? That was terrible!
A: That day I was going to walk home with him, but I decided to go to the library.
B: I can't believe it. Is he okay?
A: He broke some bones, but other than that, he is okay.
B: Oh, great! So, why are you collecting money for him?
A: The hospital bills are sort of steep. His parents can't afford it.
B: Oh, wow! Well, here is my last $10. Please send my best to Chris.
A: Thank you. Every dollar counts.
B: Bless your heart for helping him out.

20
A: Did you hear about Joseph and Michelle?
B: No, what happened? Did they have a divorce?
A: Oh, no. They are pregnant.
B: Really? How far along is Michelle?
A: Joseph told me that she is four months.
B: Oh, okay. How is he handling the news?
A: He was a mess the last time I saw him.
B: How is he now? Is he still crazy?
A: Actually, he seems relaxed and collected.
B: I can't believe Joseph is going to be a father.
A: It's trippy, huh? He is our age.
B: This is making me feel really old.

21
A: Can I ask you a question?
B: Sure, go ahead.
A: How is your relationship with your parents?
B: It's good. I get along with my father more than I do with my mother.
A: If I may ask, why is that?
B: I'm not comfortable answering that. Why are you asking?
A: It's for a class project. Why don't you get along with your mother?
B: What class are you doing this for?
A: It's for my psychology class. Do you live with your dad or mom?
B: I live with my dad.
A: Do you think that's why you don't get along with your mom?
B: I said I'm not comfortable talking about that. Change the subject.

22
A: Come in, please. Take a seat wherever you like.
B: Thank you. It's been a long and hot day.
A: It has been a hot one. Would you like something to drink?
B: What do you have?
A: We have soda, juice, and bottled water.
B: I'll take bottled water, and my wife would like one, too.
A: Sounds good. Would you like it in a glass with ice?
B: Yes, that sounds wonderful.
A: We also have some slices of pineapple. Would you like some?
B: Pineapple would hit the spot. I would love some.
A: Does your wife want some as well?
B: Actually, she doesn't like pineapple. Thanks, anyway.

23
A: I didn't like the way you sang tonight.
B: Oh, wow. Well, thanks for coming out.
A: You didn't put in all your effort. That's all I'm saying.
B: Okay, well I'm going to leave now.
A: Why are you in a rush to leave?
B: Because you are being rude, and I don't want to speak to you.
A: Well, now I know you can't take criticism.
B: It's not that I can't take criticism; it's that I don't like jerks.
A: How am I a jerk? I'm just giving you my honest opinion.
B: Well, in my honest opinion, I don't care what you think.
A: Now, that was rude. I don't want to talk to you anymore.
B: Great. Believe me; I won't be losing any sleep.

24
A: It's 4 a.m. already? I have to be getting home.
B: You can stay over if you want. I have an extra bed.
A: I appreciate the gesture, but I must get home.
B: Do you want to hang out tomorrow night?
A: I would love that. I will call you after I get out of work.
B: What time do you get out?
A: If my boss isn't there, I should be getting out at around 8:00 p.m.
B: And if your boss is there?
A: Then I will be getting out sometime around 10:00 p.m.
B: Great. We could go grab a drink after you get out of work.
A: That sounds lovely, good night.
B: Good night. Drive home safely.
