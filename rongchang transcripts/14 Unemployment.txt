A: Hey Diana, why so glum?
B: Aw Bobby, I just lost my job.
A: Oh, no. What happened?
B: The company is relocating to another state.
A: That's tough, Diana. What are you going to do now?
B: I'm looking for a new job. I need to pay my bills.
A: Are you filing for unemployment benefits?
B: I don't think I'm eligible. I only worked there three months.
A: Sure, you're eligible. You worked long enough.
B: I didn't know that.
A: I think you only have to work for two weeks to be eligible.
B: That's great. I hope I can get it.
A: You'll never know untill you try.
B: Thanks, Bobby. You're a good friend.

A: Good Morning! EDD, how can I help you?
B: Hello, I recently lost my job. Can I file for unemployment?
A: Yes, you certainly can.
B: How do I file a claim?
A: The easiest way is to go online.
B: All right, I will. What's the website.
A: Just do a search for "EDD" and you will see the site.
B: I will, but what if I need help?
A: There's online help, but if you still need help, call back.
B: Okay, I will. Thank you.

A: Hello. What are you doing here?
B: Hi! I lost my job, so here I am at the EDD.
A: That's rough. I lost my job three months ago.
B: I didn't know that. Maybe you can help me apply.
A: Sure, I can help. You just need some basic information about your job history.
B: I have that information for the company I last worked for.
A: They ask for information on all places you worked for the last 18 months.
B: I can get that. What else do they ask?
A: Name, residence, addresses, that kind of stuff, and most importantly, why you're not working.
B: You mean if I quit, or was fired.
A: Yes, and be truthful. They will call your former employers.
A: Thanks. That helps a lot.

A: Do you know what forms I need to file an unemployment claim?
B: You can go to an EDD office or fill out a form on their website to open a claim.
A: Is it really that simple?
B: It sure is. It is easier to do online.
A: Why would I want to do it online?
B: It's faster, and you can do it from home, or wherever you have Internet access.
A: Do you know the website?
B: Yes, it's edd.ca.gov. It's easy to use.
A: Then what do I do?
B: You will have to find a link that says "Apply Here", and click on it.
A: Is that all there is to it?
B: That's it. You're good to go.

A: Good morning. How can I help you?
B: Good morning to you. Yes. I'd like to file a claim.
A: Okay, I can help you with that.
B: All right. What do I need to do?
A: The easiest way to file a claim is online. You can use our computers for that.
B: That's wonderful. Do I need to log in?
A: No, you don't. Our computers are connected directly to the EDD.
B: But I don't know if I'm eligible for benefits.
A: The EDD will make that decision. Just fill in the forms as best you can.
B: Thank you. I'll use the computer here to file the claim right away.
A: If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
B: All right. I will. Thanks once again.

A: Did you bring the mail in today?
B: Yeah. I got it right here.
A: Oh, great. I'm waiting for my unemployment check. It's late.
B: Sorry to tell you, your payment didn't come today.
A: No way. Darn it! It's more than a week late!
B: Why don't you call EDD? I think they can tell you where it is.
A: I definitely need to call them.
B: I think it's an automated system.
A: Oh darn. I don't like automated systems.
B: The EDD system is not so bad.
A: Okay, I'll call. This is the longest the check has taken to get to me.
B: If you have problems with the system, you can speak to a person by dialing "0".

7
A: I just got off the phone with the EDD.
B: What did they say? Are you going to get benefits?
A: Yes, but not as much as I thought.
B: What do you mean?
A: I thought I would receive a certain amount per month, but I got less.
B: Why is that?
A: I'm not really sure. It has something to do with how much I earned.
B: They pay benefits based on your income?
A: Yes. I think the more you earn, the more you receive.
B: That's interesting. I didn't know that.
A: I think I may go to the EDD office to ask about it.
B: You should go. What have you got to lose?

8
A. How are you doing?
B. Good! What's going on?
A. Not too much. I'm on my way to the EDD.
B. Wait a minute. I thought you found a job last month.
A: I did. I'm not going there to file a claim.
B: Then why are you heading out there?
A: The EDD is hiring, that's why.
B: Wow! That's awesome. That's a very good place to work.
A: I know. That's why I'm going.
B: The pay is good, and the benefits are excellent.
A: Yes, my sister works there.
B: Good luck to you. I may have to go there myself now.

9
A: Hello, my name is George.
B: Hello, George. How can I help you?
A: I'm trying to file a claim online, but I have questions.
B: Okay, give me a moment and I'll go over there to help you.
A: Hello again. Thanks for coming over.
B: It's my pleasure. What are you having trouble with?
A: It's this question here. I'm not sure what it is asking for.
B: The system is asking for the reason you are no longer working.
A: Does that make a difference?
B: Yes it does. We review every person's case individually.
A: My company went out of business.
B: Then just put "Company out of business." You should be okay.

10
A: Good morning. How are you today?
B: I'm doing well. Thank you.
A: Are you here for our workshop today?
B: Yes, as a matter of fact, I am.
A: That's wonderful. This will help quite a bit.
B: Will you be giving the workshop?
A: Yes I will, with a couple of my colleagues.
B: How many people are you expecting?
A: Not many, unfortunately.
B: What do you mean?
A: Everyone should attend if possible. This makes filing so easy.
B: I'll tell my friend Joseph. He's coming tomorrow.

11
A: I was hoping you could help me.
B: I'll try. What help do you need?
A: I'm having an interview tomorrow morning. I'm very nervous.
B: That's great! Why are you nervous though?
A: I don't do well in interviews.
B: They can be frightening, but you can do it.
A: I'm afraid they'll ask me something I won't know.
B: You should prepare yourself. Go online, and look at their website.
A: Now why didn't I think of that?
B: It's a good idea to know everything you can about them first.
A: That's an excellent idea! Thanks.
B: You're welcome. If you need more help, give me a call.
