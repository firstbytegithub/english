A: I'm a bit nervous, Charlie.
B: Why, baby?
A: Well, you know, new neighborhood, new surroundings.
B: Change is good, Linda. Before long, you'll feel right at home.
A: I hope so. I guess I'm just used to the old place.
B: I know what you mean, baby, but this is a much better neighborhood.
A: Yes, it is, but it's still something new.
B: We'll be fine. In a month it will feel like home.
A: I hope our neighbors are nice.
B: Me too, but that's not a deal-breaker. This is a much better place.
A: I know, dear. It's just my jitters, that's all.
B: We will get through this, babe.

A: Hi, I'm Janet. I live next door.
B: Oh, hello Janet. I'm Richard, and this is my wife Wendy.
A: We're going to be living side by side; we should make the best of it.
B: I totally agree.
A: My husband will be home soon. He wants to meet you, too.
B: That would be great. I was hoping to make new friends.
A: Me too. I knew the Thompsons for years. They lived where you do now.
B: How long have you lived here?
A: For 25 years. I love this neighborhood.
B: That sounds perfect to us.

A: I think this new place will work out great.
B: Why do you say that, Dan?
A: It seems there's so much nearby.
B: Like what, baby?
A: Didn't you see all the grocery stores?
B: I saw a couple.
A: There are lots of them, and some specialty shops.
B: That's great. Like what?
A: I saw a produce stand, and a butcher market next to each other.
B: Where was that?
A: Not far. I'll take you later.
B: That sounds great. I look forward to it.

4
A: I can't believe we're actually moved in.
B: I know. It's like a dream come true.
A: We found the stores, and schools. It's time to find a church now.
B: Yes. I can't believe I forgot about that.
A: We've been very busy, Marcy. That's okay.
B: How do we find one?
A: I guess we can call our old pastor.
B: That's right. He will know.
A: It's either that, or check the Internet.
B: I think I like the pastor idea better.
A: Yes. He can probably give us the name of the local pastor.
B: I'm so eager to start now.

5
A: There certainly are a lot of places to eat around here.
B: Yes, there are. Where shall we go tonight?
A: Why don't we ask our new neighbors for a recommendation?
B: That's a great idea. They seem very friendly.
A: Yes, and they have lived here for a long time.
B: There she is. Let me ask her.
A: What did she say, honey?
B: She recommended a couple of places. What are you craving?
A: How about a nice steak?
B: Good. She said there was a good steak house about a mile away.
A: Excellent. Did you ask her if it was expensive.
B: Yes, I did. She said it was very reasonable. Let's go.

6
A: Now that we're settled in, it's time to do some exploring.
B: I know what you mean. Everything is so new.
A: I think I saw a shopping mall off the highway.
B: Was it far?
A: Not really, but we did move to an isolated place.
B: Yeah, I know. I didn't figure on this.
A: Let's go. It's not that far.
B: Okay, I'll get ready.
A: Alright, I'll get the car out. It's only about 15 minutes away.
B: I hope it has a lot of shops.
A: It looked pretty big.
B: Okay, let's go.

7
A: Hey, this is a nice library.
B: It is. I didn't expect this.
A: It doesn't look like much from the outside.
B: Didn't you know you can't tell a book by its cover?
A: That's funny, babe.
B: Anyway, we're going to need to get new library cards.
A: I'll go ask about it.
B: Okay, I'm going to check the place out.
A: I went ahead and applied for a card. You need to do the same.
B: I will right now, but look at this exhibit.
A: Wow, it's beautiful. What is it?
B: I'm not sure, but I'm going to find out.

8
A: It's time to go, Richard.
B: Okay, Patty. I'm ready.
A: I'm really stoked about this new school. Judy is going to love it.
B: I know. I've heard so many good things about it.
A: Did you make an appointment?
B: No, it wasn't necessary. They're enrolling new students this week.
A: Okay, I just hope there're not too many people.
B: I think we'll be okay. There're not too many cars in the lot.
A: I'm glad we brought her transcripts. I think that will make this smoother.
B: Yes, I'm sure it will. That was a good idea.
A: Okay, let's get this done.
B: I'm ready, babe.

9
A: I need to get to the airport by 6 o'clock.
B: That's in less than 45 minutes. You'll never make it.
A: I have to try. I was hoping to get the shuttle home.
B: Why did you wait so long?
A: It was my boss. He kept us late.
B: Well, there goes a taxi.
A: Taxi! Taxi! Darn, someone else got it.
B: You're going to have a hard time getting a taxi at this hour.
A: I know, but what can I do? Taxi!
B: Well, good luck, George. I'm taking the subway.
A: Okay, have a good weekend. Taxi!

10
A: You want to go for a walk?
B: Sure! Where to?
A: I was thinking of going to the park.
B: Isn't it a bit far?
A: Not really. We'll just take our time. It's very beautiful there.
B: Okay, let's go.
A: Look at the swans. Do you see them?
B: They're gorgeous. Look at how white those plumes are.
A: And the lake looks so calm.
B: It does. This was a great idea.
A: I know. I do this walk often.
B: I didn't even think it was that far; it's so beautiful.

11
A: Let's take the kids to the park.
B: Hey, that sounds like a good idea!
A: Yes, the fresh air will do them good.
B: Yeah, they've been cooped up all week.
A: It's like summer out today.
B: Okay, I'll get them ready.
A: There is so much to do there.
B: What, like swings, and rides?
A: Yes, and much more. They're going to love it.
B: What have you planned?
A: I was thinking about taking them on a boat ride.
B: Oh, they'll love that. Can I go too?
