A: Check out my birthday haul!

A: My relatives were really generous.
B: What are you gonna buy with it?
A: Well, I'm going to save half of it.
B: What?! You could buy so much with this!
A: I know, but I want to save some for later.
B: Well, maybe you can still afford that new video game.
A: No way! I'm going to stretch this money.
B: How are you going to do that?
A: I'm going to buy used games instead.
B: Well, I guess a used game is better than nothing.

A: Do you want to come with me to Walmart?
B: What do you need to buy?
A: I'm out of groceries.
B: Groceries are expensive at Walmart!
A: You really think so?
B: Yes! You should buy groceries at the market.
A: I also need some new blankets.
B: Well, you'd buy that at Walmart.
A: If Walmart sells both, why go to different stores?
B: You'll save money if you do.
A: Why will I save money by going to different stores?

A: Yeah, there are a few things.
B: Write down a list so we can go shopping.
A: Alright. Here you go, I'm all done!
B: This is a pretty long list!
A: There's a lot of stuff I need.
B: I don't think you need a disco ball.
A: Of course I do! It goes with the strobe light.
B: Please write a more practical list.

A: I need new clothes.
B: What kinds of new clothes?
A: I want something stylish.
B: What do you want new clothes for?
A: Well, school starts again in a week.
B: Looking good costs money, though.
A: I know what you mean.
B: The stuff you're looking for is expensive.
A: Yeah, I don't have much money.
B: Maybe you should try bargain shopping.
A: That sounds like something my mom would do.
B: Hey, moms are good at saving money.

A: That is such a cute dress!
B: Thanks! I bought it yesterday.
A: Have you worn it yet?
B: No, I have to accessorize it first!
A: Did you buy everything you needed?
B: Yep! I have a matching belt, a purse, and shoes now!
A: Well, put it on so we can see it!
B: What do you think?
A: It looks nice on you!
B: Are you sure it doesn't make me look fat?
A: No way! It totally flatters your figure.
B: Thanks! I hope my boyfriend likes it, too.

A: I don't know which size to get.
B: Why don't you check your shoes?
A: Sizes are different with each shoe style.
B: I guess you'll have to measure your foot.
A: how do I do that?
B: There's a chart by your chair you put your foot on.
A: Oh, I found it, thanks.
B: What size are you?
A: I'm a size eight.
B: You have a small shoe size for a man.
A: It's alright, shoe size doesn't matter.
B: No. Shoe size does matter.

A: What are you planning to buy?
B: A couch, a coffee table, and a reading chair.
A: Won't that be expensive?
B: There's a great sale going on right now!
A: Oh, that's great! You'll get good prices.
B: I hope I find what I'm looking for.
A: Will you have it delivered?
B: No. I borrowed a pickup truck from a friend.

A: I can't believe the coffee maker broke!
B: Well, it was a pretty old model.
A: I guess it did last quite a few years.
B: We should buy a new one.
A: Do you want to buy the same model?
B: Maybe it's time we upgrade.
A: What do you mean by that?
B: Well, now we can buy a better coffee maker.
A: What did you have in mind?
B: Maybe something with more functions!
A: I would really like an expresso maker.
B: It's settled, then! We'll buy a new coffee maker!

A: Excuse me, sir. How much for this lamp?
B: I'll sell it to you for $50.
A: Oh, no! That's way too expensive.
B: What price did you have in mind?
A: Maybe something closer to one fourth that much.
B: I might as well give it away for that price!
A: What about half?
B: That's still not enough of a profit.
A: I'll give you $30 for it.
B: Make it $35 and you've got a deal.
A: Alright, that sounds good to me.
B: You sure drive a hard bargain!

14
A: Excuse me. I would like to return this.
B: What seems to be the problem?
A: It's not working correctly.
B: When did it start having problems?
A: As soon as I took it out of the box.

A: No, I think I'd just like my money back.
B: Alright. Did you pay with a credit card?
A: Yes, I paid with the store credit card.
B: I'll return the purchase price to your card.

16
A: Hi, I need assistance, please.
B: How can I help you today?
A: My phone refuses to turn on anymore.
B: It looks like it short circuited.
A: Well, I did drop it many times.
B: I'm afraid I can't help you.
A: I guess I'll have to use the warranty.
B: According to your contract, you may choose a new phone.
A: I'll just get the same brand again.
B: Will you need the warranty?
A: No. Just have the phone.
B: Make sure you don't go dropping it!

17
A: Excuse me; I'd like to use the warranty on my phone.
B: What do you mean use the warranty?
A: The warranty promises a new phone if this one breaks.
B: Did something happen to it?
A: I dropped it and the screen cracked very badly.
B: It says here that your warranty has expired.
A: What! That can't be true!
B: I'm afraid it was only good for a year, sir.
A: What am I supposed to do with a busted phone?
B: Well, if you trade it in, you'll get a discount.
A: Well, I suppose it won't hurt.
B: I suggest you buy a longer warranty on this one, sir.
