1
A: Are you ready for dinner?
B: I sure am. Where are we going?
A: I thought we could try the new Italian place.
B: Oh, that's so heavy.
A: That's never bothered you before.
B: I know. The food is good, but it's a ton of carbs, and calories.
A: But very tasty.
B: We should try eating healthier.
A: So what do you suggest?
B: How about the Thai Hut?
A: You know I like that place, too. So what's the difference.
B: It's just not as heavy. Let's go there, okay?

2
A: Are you having dinner with us tonight?
B: Yes I am. I'll be out of work soon.
A: Okay, I'm thinking of the Pasta House.
B: Oh, that place gets crowded. Maybe we should make reservations.
A: That's a good idea. We waited an hour the last time.
B: Yes. It is best to do that first.
A: What time should we set the reservation for?
B: Well, I'll be home by 6 o'clock.
A: Okay, I'll make the call. I'll let you know.
B: That's great, thanks. I hoped they're not booked.
A: We should be able to get a table. I'll call right now.
B: Don't worry about the time. We can eat later if we have to.

3
A: Welcome to the Silver Wok. How can I help you?
B: Hello, I was hoping you have a table.
A: We should be okay. How many guests?
B: It's a birthday dinner. We have 12 guests.
A: Oh, let me check if I have room for you. Your name, please.
B: I'm Mr. Johnson. I would appreciate it.
A: Okay, Mr. Johnson. I will have a table soon.
B: Oh, that's wonderful.
A: It's near the back. Is that okay?
B: Yes, I suppose it is. I was hoping for window seating though.
A: I can accommodate you, but it will take a little more time, sir.
B: That's okay. We'll wait.

4
A: Good Evening. I am Joseph, and I'll be your waiter tonight.
B: Hello, Joseph.
A: Can I start you off with some refreshments?
B: Yes, you can. I'll take a Long Island Iced Tea.
A: And for the lady?
B: She will have a vodka martini.
A: Those are excellent choices. How about the kids?
B: They will take regular iced teas.
A: Will there be anything else?
B: Yes, as a matter of fact. Can you bring me a beer chaser?
A: Certainly. What kind of beer would you like?
B: I want something imported. How about something from Mexico?

5
A: Now that you have your beverages, can I offer you some appetizers?
B: Yes, that sounds good. What do you have?
A: We have a wide selection of tempting appetizers.
B: May I see a menu, please?
A: Certainly. It's on the regular menu under "Appetizers."
B: Can you recommend something?
A: Of course. The potato skins are very popular.
B: Hmmm. I don't like potatoes much. What else you got?
A: How about some stuffed mushrooms, or fried zucchini?
B: That sounds better, but I'm still not sold.
A: We have an appetizer platter that includes all our selections.
B: That sounds excellent. Let's have it.

6
A: Are you ready to order?
B: Yes, I think we are, thank you.
A: Okay, what can I get you?
B: I like the look of that plate on the next table.
A: Oh yes, sir. That's our seafood platter.
B: What does it come with?
A: Fried white fish, shrimp, and scallops, along with fries, and vegetables.
B: Does it come with a salad?
A: Of course. It comes with the soup of the day, and a green salad.
B: What's the soup of the day.
A: Today's soup is clam chowder.
B: Is that New England, or Manhattan style?
A: It is the creamy-white, New England style.
B: Oh, that's my favorite. I'll take the soup.

7
A: Waiter!
B: Yes, sir. How can I help you?
A: That was an excellent meal, but we could not finish.
B: Would you like a doggy-bag to take your leftovers home?
A: Yes, please. We would.
B: And did you leave enough room for dessert?
A: Dessert? Why yes, I think so.
B: Here is our dessert menu.
A: Do you have a house specialty?
B: Yes, we do. It's the apple pie a la mode.
A: That sounds good. What kind of ice cream do you have?
B: Vanilla, French vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.
A: I'll take the pie a la mode, but put the ice cream on the side, not on top.
B: Excellent choice! Okay, ice cream on the side.

A: Here comes our food. I'm so hungry. It looks delicious.
B: Here's your order.
A: Excuse me, but I don't think this order is correct.
B: Really? What did you order?
A: I ordered the fried chicken. This is grilled.
B: Let me check. Oh yes, you did order the fried chicken.
A: Yes, I did. Thank you.
B: Not to worry. I'll get your order out in no time.
A: Please do. Two of us would like to eat at the same time.
B: If you like, I can keep your plate warm while preparing her meal.

A: Honey, this steak looks delicious.
B: Yes, it does, Michael. It has a nice color.
A: Yum, and it's perfectly cooked.
B: It looks a bit rare. How did you order it?
A: Medium-rare, as always.
B: That looks rare to me, dear.
A: It might be a bit pink on the inside, but I don't care. This is delicious.
B: That's all that matters, dear.
A: I have to tell the waiter to send my compliments to the chef.
B: That would be a nice gesture.
A: The baked potato is also very tasty.
B: Well, make sure you tell the chef that also.

10
A: Here's your dinner, folks. Enjoy!
B: Thank you. This looks delicious.
A: You're welcome.
B: Excuse me.
A: Yes, how can I help you?
B: This salmon steak tastes a little funny.
A: Funny? In what way?
B: I don't know for sure, but, I think it might be spoiled.
A: Not to worry. We will bring you a new steak.
B: Yes, please do. This one turned my stomach.
A: Oh, no. Are you okay?
B: I think so, but I'm not in the mood for dinner now.
A: That's perfectly alright. We will refund your money.

11
A: That was an excellent meal. Don't you think so, Judy?
B: Absolutely! I especially liked the dessert.
A: Yes, me too. That chocolate cake was delicious.
B: Here comes our waitress.
A: Hello again, and thank you. That was very good.
B: Yes, the dessert was delicious.
A: I would like the bill, please.
B: Her service and attitude were good also. How much are you tipping her?
A: You're right about the service. I think 20 percent.
B: Twenty percent? That's a bit high, isn't it?
A: I know, but the food was good, and the service was excellent.
B: You're right, dear. She deserves it.

12
A: Wow! Our order is sure taking long.
B: Yes, it is. It's been nearly 45 minutes now.
A: Well, maybe they're just very busy.
B: I don't know, dear. I was watching our waiter.
A: What did you see?
B: He actually handed in orders for two tables before us.
A: You mean after he took our order.
B: Yes. He was goofing off. I could see him from here.
A: How do you know he did this.
B: Like I said, I was watching. He forgot our order.
A: That's terrible.
B: Yes, well he's not going to get a good tip from me.

13
A: Have you heard of the new burger place down the street?
B: Yes, I have. Have you tried it yet?
A: It's the bomb. The burgers are so good.
B: Is it expensive?
A: Not really. Not more than most places.
B: What do you like about it?
A: The food is great, and the waitresses bring you food on roller skates.
B: That's like those old-time drive-in places.
A: Yes, it is. Like in the â€˜50s.
B: Wow, I got to go there soon.
A: I would highly recommend it.
B: Thanks. I'll definite go.

14
A: I just came back from eating at the new steak place.
B: Oh, I've been wanting to go there. How was it?
A: Don't bother going.
B: Really? Why?
A: It was terrible. The food was cold, and the service sucked.
B: Oh, no. I was looking forward to trying it out.
A: Like I said, don't bother.
B: I mean, how bad was the food?
A: It was awful. They got my order wrong, and it was cold.
B: Well, maybe it was just an isolated incident.
A: I don't think so. I spoke to other diners, and they were disappointed, too.
B: I guess that means I have to find another place.

15
A: So what are you ordering?
B: I'm not sure. I like their burgers.
A: Yeah, me too. Have you tried their fish sandwich?
B: Yuck. Yes, I have. I didn't like it.
A: Really? Why not?
B: It was too greasy. I think I'll get the No. 2 instead.
A: What's that?
B: That's their bacon burger special.
A: Is it good?
B: It's very tasty. They use thick bacon.
A: Oh, good. Other places use paper-thin bacon.
B: I think I like think bacon better.
