5

A: The apartment seems nice.
B: It sure does.
A: I just have a few questions to ask.
B: About what?
A: The apartment's location.
B: Ask away. I'll try my best to answer them.
A: Is the location in close proximity to the police department?
B: Yes, it is. Only fifteen minutes away.
A: What about the fire department?
B: Not as close as the police department, but still not far.
A: That's good to hear. Thanks for the answers.
B: Don't mention it. It was my pleasure to help.

8
A: What can you tell me about the neighborhood?
B: Only good things.
A: Like what, for example?
B: The neighborhood is a safe and clean place.
A: Is there any crime?
B: There is hardly any crime that is reported.
A: I wonder why that is.
B: There is a neighborhood watch that patrols daily.
A: That explains crime disparity.
B: Any other questions?
A: Who are the residents living in the neighborhood?
B: Mostly families and some retired folks.
A: Sounds like a pleasant neighborhood.
B: It really is. I hope you enjoy living there.

9
A: I have a few questions regarding the neighborhood.
B: Alright, let's hear them.
A: Does the neighborhood look good aesthetically?
B: Yes, very much so.
A: That's good news. Can you describe how?
B: The neighborhood is abundant with plant life.
A: You mean like trees and bushes?
B: Yes, and not just any regular trees and bushes. The ones here are beautiful.
A: Anything else you can describe?
B: Yes. The streets are nicely paved, and the street lights are quite quaint.
A: Wow, I could just picture it now.
B: The neighborhood will look even better in person.

10
A: Tell me about the apartment's safety features.
B: What would you like to know?
A: Do the front and back door equip with locks?
B: But of course, they do.
A: What kind of locks do they have?
B: The best deadbolt locks in town.
A: I'm glad to hear that.
B: Rest assured that you will be safe and sound in your new apartment.
A: That's comforting to hear. I thank you for your words.
B: Not a problem. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
A: Let me think for a second.
B: Take all the time you need.
A: Alright, I got one.
B: Okay, let's hear it.
A: Does the apartment have an alarm system?
B: It in fact does! It's a very important safety feature to have.

11
A: Do you have the floor plan to the apartment?
B: Yes I do. Would you like to take a look at it?
A: Yes I would, if you don't mind.
B: Not at all. By all means, take a look for yourself.
A: Where did you get this piece of paper of the floor plan?
B: I have access to this kind of information.
A: I see. Can you help me read this?
B: Sure I can. What would you like to know?
A: How big is the living room?
B: According to the floor plan it is 20 feet long and 15 feet wide.
A: Oh, so that's what those numbers mean.
B: Right. This apartment has a good floor plan.

12
A: Is there any kind of discrimination committed in the city?
B: Not that I have witnessed.
A: What about any reports?
B: Of discrimination? I wouldn't know, to be honest.
A: Do you know where I could get access to that kind of information?
B: Perhaps the police department. What made you ask in the first place?
A: I was just curious. It never hurts to ask.
B: I wouldn't worry too much about discrimination.
A: Why do you say that?
B: We live in progressive times now.
A: That doesn't mean discrimination isn't committed in this day and age.
B: I guess you are right.

13
A: Hello, I would like to schedule an appointment to view the apartment.
B: Sure thing. What is your name?
A: My name is Lisa.
B: Okay, Lisa. I have an appointment available at three o'clock.
A: Three o'clock is just fine. On what day would that be?
B: I have days available from Saturday through Monday.
A: Can you do Friday instead?
B: No, I'm sorry. My son is visiting on Friday.
A: I understand. In that case, can I come the following day?
B: Saturday? that's great! See you then.

14
A: Good afternoon. Are you the person renting out the apartment?
B: Yes, I am. What can I do for you?
A: I'm interested in viewing the apartment.
B: Alright, would like to make an appointment?
A: Yes, I very much would.
B: What time are you available?
A: Mostly after sundown on weekdays. What days are good for you?
B: I work in the evenings Monday through Friday. Are you available at any time on the weekends?
A: I'm available on Sunday. How about three o'clock Sunday afternoon? 
B: That's a perfect time for me.
A: Great! I'll come over at three on Sunday.
B: Sure! I'm expecting you.

15
A: It's a nice apartment.
B: I knew you would like it. Who wouldn't?
A: There is only one issue.
B: What is it? Is it the next door neighbor?
A: No, he's great. I was talking about the price.
B: What about the price? It's a fair price, if I do say so myself.
A: I think it's a little too high for me. Is there anything you can do for me?
B: I'm not sure if I can.
A: Listen, I would be the perfect tenant.
B: And how is that?
A: Well, I always make my payments on time. You can check my credit score.
B: Alright, that's good to hear.
A: I sleep early, and am very respectable. I also have no pets.
B: I think I've heard enough. You sound like a good tenant. I'm going to reduce the monthly rent by $100.

16
A: Is there anything I can say or do to make you lower the monthly rent?
B: I doubt it, but let me hear you out.
A: If you lower the price, I will mow the lawn and trim the hedges every month.
B: No, I already have someone who does that.
A: What if I give you the first two months' rent in advance?
B: No deal. Sorry, kid.
A: Looks like I can't convince you to lower the rent.
B: I'm sorry, but that was a good effort.
A: I guess I'm going to have such a hard time paying rent.
B: Don't look so down now.
A: I can't help it.
B: Alright, you win! I'll lower the price.

17
A: I think I'm ready to sign the lease.
B: Good! Let me just go over some key points.
A: If you feel the need to do so, then go ahead.
B: By signing this contract, you are agreeing to rent the apartment for a certain amount of time.
A: Yes, I am aware of this. The lease is for one year.
B: Are you ready to make that commitment?
A: Yes, I am. What else?
B: No pets in the apartment.
A: Don't worry. I have no pets.
B: There'll be a late fee of $20 if you don't pay on time.
A: I have no problem with that. Where do I sign?
B: Write your signature here, and your initials here and here.

18
A: Let's discuss the security deposit.
B: Do you have the full amount for the deposit?
A: I think I do. How much was it again?
B: It was a total of $1,000.
A: Can you please explain how a security deposit works?
B: You don't know? I thought you did.
A: I just want to make sure I have it correct.
B: The security deposit ensures coverage for any damages you may cause to the apartment at your departure.
A: I see. Is that it or is there more to it?
B: The security deposit also could be used to help repay any owing rent you may have.
A: Okay, that's what I was thinking. Thanks for confirming that information.
B: Sure thing. You're welcome.

19
A: This is a great apartment.
B: I'm glad you found it to your liking.
A: I knew I would, judging from the description I read.
B: Are you ready to discuss payment?
A: Yes, I think I am.
B: You will have to pay for the security deposit.
A: Security deposit? What is that for?
B: It's simply money you give to me as a kind of insurance in case you cause any damage to the apartment.
A: I understand. That makes sense.
B: So are you ready to pay the deposit?
A: How much are you asking?
B: It's at least $1,000 for the security deposit.
A: Alright, I could provide that much.
B: Perfect! I think we are ready to sign the lease.

20
A: What's your policy towards owning pets in the apartment?
B: I usually don't permit any kind of pets.
A: Would you be willing to make an exception?
B: It depends on the pet. Are you a pet owner?
A: I have a few rabbits and hamsters.
B: How many exactly?
A: I have two rabbits and three hamsters.
B: As long as you keep them inside your apartment I don't see why they would be a problem.
A: I'm guessing cats and dogs are not permitted?
B: Not, they are not. I'm sorry to say.
A: Did something happen that made you change your policy towards cats and dogs?
B: Yes. A tenant previously owned a dog and the dog attacked another tenant one day.

21
A: Everything seems to be in order. I'm ready to move into the apartment.
B: Good, I welcome you to your new home.
A: Is there anything else I should know before I start my move?
B: Now that you mention it, yes, there is. It's the policy I have on pets.
A: Do you allow any kind of pets?
B: Only caged pets, I'm sorry to say. I hope this won't be a problem.
A: Actually, I might prove to be problematic because I have a cat.
B: There lies the problem. I'm sorry, but some of the other tenants have allergies to cats.
A: That's too bad. I don't know what I'm going to do with the kitten.
B: Perhaps you can give it away. Do you know of anyone who might want a cat?
A: No, not really. What about you? Would you like a cat?
B: Me? Well, I've never owned a pet before, let alone a cat.
A: Cats make great companions. Please take mine. You would be doing me a huge favor.
B: Alright, why not? Bring the little fellow next time.

22
A: Can I check the apartment for any damages?
B: Absolutely, let me accompany you.
A: Did the previous tenant maintain the apartment well?
B: For the most part, yes. A few repairs had to be made.
A: What kind of repairs?
B: Mostly plumbing repairs, but the exterior of the apartment is immaculate.
A: Whoa, you weren't kidding. This apartment is in mint condition.
B: I wouldn't worry too much about the plumbing.
A: It's all in working condition?
B: Yes, I guarantee that is. I hired the best plumber in town to fix the minor problems it had.
A: That's good to hear. I think I've finished checking the apartment.
B: Don't hesitate to notify me of any concerns that may arise.

23
A: Would it be okay if I checked the apartment for any damages?
B: That's fine with me. Step inside.
A: Thank you. I'll take a quick look around.
B: Feel free to take your time.
A: Right away I noticed some cracks on the kitchen tile.
B: Where? Can you show me?
A: Yes. It's right at the corner, next to the sink.
B: I see it. I'll have that repaired right away.
A: Thank you. That would be great.
B: Take a carful look around the apartment, and tell me of anything else that needs tending to.
A: Here's something else. These doors are kind of loose.
B: It's the screws on them. I'll have the screws replaced as soon as possible.

24
A: Do any public buses run nearby?
B: Yes, in fact many buses do.
A: Can you tell me where I can catch them?
B: Down the street the 260 bus picks you up and takes you to Los Angeles.
A: How frequently does it pass?
B: That bus passes every 30 minutes.
A: How much is the fare?
B: For most it's two dollars and fifty cents.
A: Is it possible to buy some kind of pass for the bus?
B: Yes, you can. There are daily, weekly, and monthly passes you can purchase.
A: Do you know the cost of them?
B: If I'm not mistaken, it's five dollars for the day, twenty dollars for the week, and fifty for the month.

25
A: Do you ever take public transportation to get around?
B: Before I frequently did. Not so much anymore. Why do you ask?
A: I wanted some information about the public transportation that is available in the city.
B: I could provide you with some. What would you like to know?
A: What kind of public transportation is there?
B: There is a local shuttle bus that could take you almost anywhere in the city.
A: It does not take you outside the city?
B: Unfortunately it does not. But it's cheaper than other public buses that do.
A: I see. And where is the nearest stop from here?
B: It's really close. Just a block away towards that direction.
A: That way? I see. Thank you.
B: You can't miss it, and you're welcome.

26
A: Have you found an apartment?
B: Yes, I have.
A: That's great. Where is it at?
B: It's in downtown. Have you ever been there?
A: No, but I hear that area could be kind of sketchy.
B: Don't worry. The apartment is in a pretty safe part of town.
A: That's a relief. When are you moving?
B: This weekend, Saturday.
A: Have you hired any movers?
B: No, I have not. Know any good movers?
A: Sure, I'll give you the number to the movers that can help you.
B: Gee, thanks. I appreciate the favor.
A: You're welcome.

27
A: Hey! Did you ever find a new apartment to move into?
B: Yes, I did! The apartment is in a convenient location.
A: Nice! Where is it located?
B: It is in the city of Pasadena and near both my school and job.
A: That's great! It seems you found the perfect place.
B: Thanks. I'm glad too. Could I ask you for a favor?
A: Sure. What is it?
B: Would you be able to help me move into my new apartment tomorrow?10 Looking for an Apartment
A: Yes, I would be glad to.
B: Awesome! I just need help moving my furniture in.
A: No problem. I'll stop by tomorrow morning.
B: Great. Maybe we can go out for pizza right after we finish.

28
A: I finally found an apartment to move in.
B: That's great to hear. Kudos to you.
A: Thanks, it wasn't easy finding one.
B: Are you moving in soon?
A: Yes I am. This weekend, in fact.
B: Have you hired any movers?
A: No, I have not.
B: Why not? Don't you know of any in the area?
A: That's not the problem. I don't think I have enough to afford movers.
B: That's too bad. Is there anything I could do to help?
A: Actually, I was going to ask for your help.
B: You're going to need at least one more other person to help you move.
A: You're right about that. So can I count on you to help me?
B: You bet. I would be happy to help you move.

29
A: Hey, were you able to find a new home to move into?
B: Yes, I did. Now I just have to move my things over to the new place.
A: That's great! I'm glad you found a new place.
B: Me too. Have you ever used a moving company before?
A: Yes, I have. And the company is not bad.
B: I'm planning on moving soon. I have never called a moving company before.
A: Oh, I see. You have to call them as soon as possible.
B: Really? Why is that?
A: Moving companies tend to get booked really fast, especially during the summer.
B: That makes sense. I guess I should call a moving company right now.
A: Good luck. I hope the move transitions smoothly.
B: Thanks you for your advice. See you later!

30
A: Hello, am I calling a moving company? My friend gave me you guys' number.
B: Yes, this is indeed a moving company.
A: That's a relief. I thought I was dialing the wrong number.
B: No, you called the right place. Are you in need of any moving assistance?
A: Yes, very much so. I'm moving in one week, and I need a pair of strong and able movers.
B: We can provide you with that kind of help.
A: That would be fantastic.
B: Just give me your information and we'll have you set up in no time.
A: Thank you very much.
B: You're welcome. The movers we provide will help with all your belongings.
A: That's good. I have a lot of stuff.
B: Rest assure, that won't be a problem.

31
A: Please be carful with that.
B: Don't worry, we are professionals. Your furniture is safe in our hands.
A: Thank you. That's reassuring to hear.
B: Now, where do you want this couch?
A: Let me think. Right here is a good spot.
B: Next to the window over there?
A: Yes, that's the spot. You could put it down there.
B: Alright, next we have these end tables. Where do you want them?
A: I want them against this wall please.
B: There you are. Nice and gentle. See, I told you we were professionals.
A: Thank you. I feel more secure now seeing you work.
B: Well, that's good. Let's go get the rest of your furniture.

32
A: Thanks for helping me move in all my furniture.
B: No problem at all. It's a pleasure.
A: Can you help me decide where to place them?
B: Sure. Where should we start?
A: Let's start with the living room. Where do you suggest we place the couch?
B: Maybe against that wall. Then the television can be placed at the opposite end.
A: Good idea. Let's do that. Thank you for helping.
B: You're welcome. Where would you like to place these bookshelves?
A: I would like it against the wall with the window.
B: Would you like it placed to the right or left side of the window?
A: I would like it placed on the right side.
B: Good choice. Let's move the bookshelf together.

33
A: Hello, is this the water company?
B: Yes it is. How can I help you?
A: I just moved into my first home. I have a few questions.
B: Alright. What questions do you have?
A: What are my payment options?
B: You can pay online, by mail, or in person at designated areas.
A: Are you guys responsible for any plumbing problems?
B: The costumer is responsible for their home plumbing problems.
A: What information do you need in order to begin my water service?
B: We will need your full name, social security number, and the address to your home.
A: Thank you. That is all I need to know.
B: You're welcome. Thank you for calling. Have a nice day.

34
A: You have called the Water Company. How may I assist you?
B: Hello, I recently moved into my apartment.
A: Are you calling to activate your billing?
B: Yes, that's one of the things I'm calling about.
A: What was the other reason for your calling today?
B: There is leakage in one of the pipelines. Is there anything you can do about that?
A: No, I'm sorry. But I could provide you contact with one of our plumbers.
B: No, that's not necessary, but thank you.
A: As for your billing, what form of payment would you like to have?
B: Can I pay online?
A: Yes, that is a service we do provide for our customers.
